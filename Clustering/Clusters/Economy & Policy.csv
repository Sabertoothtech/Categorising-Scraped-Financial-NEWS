In late March, it was reported that over 28 million people applied for about 90,000jobsin the Indian Railways. Even more recently, 200,000 applicants – including 423 with bachelor’s degrees in engineering, 167 MBAs, 543 postgraduates in commerce, 28 with BEds, 34 masters in computer science, 159 M.Scs, 25 with bachelor’s degrees in mass media and communication, and 167 BBAs – applied for 1,167jobsof police constables in Mumbai.', 'Clearly, much is not well on thejobmarket front even though there are claims by the government that the problem is not one of missingjobsbut missing data onjobs.The challenge ofjobsis especially acute because of the current and growing size of India’s young population.', 'According to a recent World Bank report: Every month, the working age increases by 1.3 million people and India must create 8.1 millionjobsa year to maintain its employment rate, which has been declining based on employment data analysed from 2005 to 2015, largely due to women leaving thejobmarket.', 'At one time, it was widely believed that India’s young population was a fantastic asset and would reap a handsome demographic dividend. Now, it is commonly acknowledged that India’s future is more uncertain and questions are being asked about the kind of economic contribution its young population can make. Half of India’s 1.3 billion people are below 25 and two-thirds are under 35. And they are desperately looking forjobs.', 'In theory, India’s young population should reap a demographic dividend for the country. However, for that to become a reality, two things are necessary. First, India’s young should be capable of doing thejobsthat are available in an era where advances in science and technology are bringing about dramatic changes in the kinds ofjobsthat are becoming available. India’s education sector – both primary and secondary education – does not inspire confidence in this regard. Employability reports of college graduates, including those with degrees in ‘professional’ disciplines, such as engineering, present a dismal picture too. There is much truth to Indian Staffing Federation’s Rituparna Chakraborty’s  statement that “no one seems to have the time to ask the bigger question, i.e. of thejobsthat are still being created, how many of them are being filled?” Alternately, however, the young should be prepared to work in more traditional sectors such as manufacturing which in turns draws attention to the second issue: that a sufficient number ofjobsmust be available or created in manufacturing for young people to be employed. The numbers cited above show that this is not happening.', 'That these are hard times for India’s young population is well-captured in Dreamers, a new book by the journalist Snigdha Poonam. More worryingly, however, the book provides frightening insights into what the future may look like for India. According to Poonam, the country’s young population share many of the cultural values of their grandparents such as social conservatism but the life goals of American teenagers, or certainly those of urban and upwardly-mobile Indians – money and fame – which are likely to prove elusive for most. Another way of saying the same thing differently is that “India doesn’t have ajobcrisis…[but] a wage crisis – everyone who wants ajobhas a job, just doesn’t have the wage they aspire for.” Mix that with the distorted views of a growing section of India’s young about what it means to be an Indian and the glories of India’s pre-colonial and pre-Islamic past and things increasingly begin to look like a recipe for a coming social disaster.', 'Another worrisome pointer in the same direction is that there are reports about India’s young not seekingjobsor opting for voluntaryunemployment.According toNITI Aayogmember Bibek Debroy, who in mid-2017 had expressed concern about it, voluntaryunemploymentis largely about people “unwilling to settle for jobs, particularly after having ‘invested’ in education” that do not give an acceptable salary. However, voluntaryunemploymentcan also refer to those young people who at one time looked forjobsand could either not get them or discovered that the kind of work they were required to do in theirjobwas not to their liking. In a more positive sense, voluntaryunemploymentcan also be about young people choosing to become entrepreneurs in preference to working for others, or choosing to study further in order to secure betterjobs.', 'According to reports, the numbers of those opting for voluntaryunemploymentis highest in less developed states with larger numbers of young people, such as Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. Mahesh Vyas, the Managing Director of Centre for MonitoringIndian Economy(CMIE), expressed the view that young people, “who have nojobsand have even stopped looking forjobscould easily stray into unlawful activities” thereby turning India’s demographic dividend into a “demographic demon.” But numbers alone should not be the only cause for worry. It is not inevitable that the voluntarily unemployed will opt for unlawful activities. What they do is shaped by the nature of political discourse in their state and the country. Even relatively smaller numbers of voluntarily unemployed in more developed states could take the path of unlawful activities when mobilised to that end by influential political leaders with the expectation that they would benefit from it.', 'In sum, tough times ahead for India’s young people have the potential to translate into hard times for the nation’s social harmony and peace.', 'Madhvi Gupta is an independent writer based in Goa.

Jackson Brown Jr once remarked: ""Opportunity dances with those already on the dance floor."" For global investors and businesses, India in the 21st century is that very dance floor -- but we must hasten to add that the investment opportunities here come with a unique set of challenges.', ""Creating abusinessout of an opportunity that appears attractive at the macro level may be beset with challenges at a micro-level. Essentially, the country's large market size in any sector presents a compelling investment opportunity, and yet the average return available per user may challenge the viability of thebusinessmodel."", 'With rising incomes, immense growth opportunities will emerge in the coming decades across telecom, aviation and other such infrastructure sectors. The consumption of goods and services is expected to rise to levels approximating those of more developed markets such as China and the US.', ""Take, as examples, the case of optical fibre cable and airline seats per capita. The optical fibre cable (much needed for 5G technology deployment) kilometres per capita in India is currently at 0.09 vis-a-vis China's 0.87 (as per CRU). In 2014, the annual airline domestic seats per capita in India stood at 0.08 vis-a-vis 2.59 in the US (as per the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, or CAPA)."", 'Bridging of the gaps in these infrastructure sectors is the opportunity investors must set their eyes on. Despite the low airline domestic seats per capita, CAPA maintains that, in terms of tickets sold, India is the third-largest and fastest-growing domestic aviation market in the world. This gives one an idea of thebusinessopportunity. With the expected increases in incomes in the foreseeable future, these opportunities will only become more attractive.', 'Despite a large aggregate market size, the lower per capita income in India leads to a low revenue per user. This phenomenon poses a challenge for prospective businesses. Vodafone presents an interesting case in this regard. In fiscal 2016-17, of its total global subscriber base of 341.7 million, 209 million were in India (about 61 per cent). Yet, revenue earned here was 6.16 billion euros, or just 12.9 percent of its total global revenue of 47.6 billion euros.', 'In abusinesssuch as telecom that requires significant capital expenditure, a low average revenue per user is a real challenge. The fact that the large subscriber base can deliver value in the future as the average revenue per user grows cannot compensate for the fact that sustaining businesses in the short to medium term can be confounding.', 'This apparent paradox of an attractivebusinessfrom a macro perspective beset with challenges at the micro level, is not unique to just the telecom sector in India. This is a challenge that businesses in general face in a country that has a large aggregate economy, but low per capita income.', 'The key to success forbusinessin India is determined by the ability of an investor to circumvent the divide between an opportunity at a macro level and the ground-level challenges. Strategies to succeed should revolve around both sides of the balance sheet. From an asset perspective, businesses need to potentially bundle services and products so that customers are willing to give the company a larger share of their wallet.', ""For example, for a telecombusinessthis could mean offering connectivity and entertainment as a package, a trend that is currently emerging. A second strategy could be to acquire the assets of or merge one's assets with another similar company to create economies of scale, a strategy Vodafone has adopted."", 'On the liability side of the balance sheet, businesses can innovate through prudent capital structure management to generate access to relatively inexpensive debt. Global interest rates are still at historic lows despite the recent rate hikes in the US. The global financial investor base is awash with liquidity and hence willing to provide high quality businesses attractive borrowing terms. A high-quality company in India can create a moat around itsbusinessby borrowing for the long term at relatively low interest rates and reap long-run benefits.', ""India does present a unique set of opportunities and challenges for global investors and businesses. That said, it is a major economy and in the years to come is projected to have one of the highest growth rates globally. One estimate is that the India's will be the third-largest economy globally by 2050. A globalbusinesssearching for growth will need to have significant market presence in India.
