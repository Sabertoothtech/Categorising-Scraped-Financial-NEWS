Since then, Greenpeace has raised about 300,000 crowns in donations.', 'A Facebook poll on the group?s website showed 95 percent support for an appeal and Greenpeace said the money involved shows the case is far more than a publicity stunt among greens.', 'The two groups appealed directly to Norway?s Supreme Court, hoping to bypass the Appeals Court.
