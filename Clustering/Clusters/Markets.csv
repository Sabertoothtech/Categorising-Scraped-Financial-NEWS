So, the average that we are looking at is 4-5 percent. If you have EPS at only 4-5 percent and prices run-up, it is leading to a very high PE.', 'But the market is essentially pricing in a rebound in the cyclicals. In the next 3-4 years, you will have very high earnings growth in cyclicals, probably led by banks which will no longer have to do as much provisioning. Infrastructure spending and higher disposable income will also aid cyclicals. So, these are a few areas where we think there will be a spurt in earnings. Therefore, over the next 3-4 years, the PE should normalise a bit. That is the hypothesis the market is based on today.', 'There are 2-3 factors which are driving it. Firstly, we have been seeing a growing number of investors, and the longer they stay, the more maturity and the experience they gather. If you have gone through previous cycles, you know that you just have to ride out the cycle. Secondly, the advisory and the distribution community has grown significantly over the last few years. So, we hope that there are a lot of investors who have someone to talk to during times of volatility, which has been missing over the last year. But as volatility returns, we are hoping that the investors will call their advisors or distributors and take guidance. Thirdly, a large part of the growth in the industry is SIP-led. One certainly hopes that it will be much longer and not as volatile in terms of flows. I don?t think we must expect too much redemption or volatility of that type.', 'Also Read:Why Mutual Funds Cannot Assure Fixed Returns', 'There is a belief that there may be a time correction rather than deep price corrections.
