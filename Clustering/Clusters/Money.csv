The main worry is due to the disappointing performance of its cash-cow Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) that has been churning out healthy profits for several years and which churned out 90% to 100% of the consolidated profits.', 'For the quarter, Tata Motors? consolidated net profit of Rs 1,212 crore missedBloomberg?s 15-broker average estimate by a huge 48%. More importantly, its operating profit, although higher than the year-ago period, was also just three-fourths of what the Street had forecast. All this, in spite of a 16% jump in consolidated net revenue on the back of strong sales volumes, especially on the home ground.', 'What this clearly shows is that the costs during the quarter overtook realizations. The glaring miss is JLR?s operating margin of 10.9% against estimates of 11.5%. In fact, fiscal year 2018 has been a challenging one so far, with operating margins in the first and second quarters at 7.9% and 11.8%, respectively, coming lower than forecasts. While the management attributes the sales slowdown to the changeover of some Range Rover models and introduction of new ones, there are other concerns too.', 'Barring China, where sales grew by 14% year-on-year during the quarter, markets in the UK, Europe and North America have been challenging. The investor presentation clearly indicates that the changing trends towards fewer diesel vehicles in Europe and the UK and the trend towards electric vehicles in North America have led to a steep drop in sales in these regions (see chart). Even growth in China has simmered down compared to a few quarters ago.', 'Reiterating this, the management in the conference call said that the cost of responding to higher competition and product changes led to higher variable costs. Along with adverse currency movements, this weighed on profitability.', 'The worry is that the market product cycle uncertainty could see a trend reversal in JLR?s performance, at least in the near term. One can anticipate higher product development costs and depreciation costs with a strain on working capital too for some time ahead, signalling negative free cash flows.', 'Fortunately, the downturn in JLR was partially offset by a recovery in Tata Motors? stand-alone business, as sales of domestic commercial vehicles shot through the roof (see chart) and passenger cars too recovered. Indeed, the company?s turnaround strategy was followed by a recovery in the domestic commercial vehicle market as a whole. Robust sales aided the transition from a loss in the year-ago period to a profit this quarter.', 'However, the stand-alone profit hardly matters except that it prevents a further drain on cash flows.', 'Without doubt, JLR?s poor performance will eclipse the uptrend in domestic business. This is already mirrored in Tata Motors? stock price that has fallen 24% in a year, while shares of its competitor on the home turf?Ashok Leyland Ltd?have risen by 37%. Tata Motors? shares have hugely underperformed even the benchmark indices in FY18 so far and are unlikely to see better days until JLR is on a firm footing once again.']"

The brokerage firm believes that new launches, store expansion and sustained increase in market share will drive sales growth by 22% compound annual growth rate over FY17-20E.', 'It is encouraging that Titan has maintained its jewellery segment revenue growth guidance at 25% for FY18 despite weaker-than- expected numbers for the December quarter. The company?s jewellery business faced a high base, as the festival season in the December 2016 quarter was a strong one with Dussehra and Diwali falling in the same quarter.', 'On a consolidated basis, jewellery revenues rose by 8% year-on-year for the December quarter. This pales in comparison to the 37% growth in the September quarter and a far higher 56% growth in the June quarter. Primary jewellery sales growth was slower, as primary billing was much higher towards the end of the September quarter in anticipation of the festive season. However, retail sales growth at 15% wasn?t disappointing given the high base.', 'Titan?s second key business?of watches?delivered a satisfactory performance. While watch revenue growth was 4.7%, the company said that if figures were restated for excise duty corrections, the growth in the quarter comes to 11%.', 'Overall, gross margin improvement and better operating efficiencies resulted in 21% net profit growth in the December quarter.', 'In future, investors should watch the extent of market share gains.

Indian and global markets are joined at the hip and the current bout of nerves is global. Local mishaps, such as the imposition of the long-term capital gains tax and higher bond yields, will lead to a lower premium over its peers for the Indian equity market, but apart from that it will move in tandem with global markets.', 'The argument for staying invested in the market usually goes like this: growth is coming back, both for the global economy and for India, earnings are doing well, so this is just a blip, a healthy correction, the pause that refreshes.', 'Yes, growth is getting better. The latest global composite Purchasing Managers? Index, a gauge of economic activity in the world, was at a 40-month high in January. Both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have forecast stronger growth this year for the world economy and for India.', 'The question though, is the price of that growth. During the 2003-08 bull run in the Indian stock market, the one-year forward price earnings multiple of the MSCI India index moved up to 17 only at the end of 2007, when the euphoria was at its peak. In May last year, it was already above 17, moving up to 18 by December.', 'This story is all about valuations. Ever since the financial crisis, central banks in the advanced economies have driven down interest rates to rock bottom and indeed into negative territory, while pumping out billions of dollars through quantitative easing. Higher asset prices were an explicit objective of central banks, which through the wealth effect was supposed to trickle down to economic growth. The policy worked as expected, driving up asset prices and expanding price earnings multiples across the world. The ratio of global stock market capitalization to GDP, as measured by the St Louis Federal Reserve, had by 2015 already crossed its 2007 peak.', 'There?s also a need for caution about growth. The IMF forecasts 3.9% growth for the world economy this year. But remember that global growth was 4.3% in 2003, 5.4% in 2004, 4.9% in 2005 and 5.5% in 2006. With interest rates so low and a tsunami of liquidity, is this all the growth we can get? Growth in global trade, crucial for emerging markets, was much stronger during 2003-07. And yet equity valuations were lower at the time. We are paying through our noses for second-rate growth.', 'That?s because global interest rates are much lower now. For example, the US 10-year government bond yield was higher than 4% for much of 2004 and 2005. Right now, analysts are saying 3% is cause for worry. With the cost of borrowing so cheap, the temptation to take a punt is strong.', 'One reason for low interest rates is low inflation. Even so, real interest rates in the US and other advanced economies are also very low. The yield on the 10-year inflation-indexed security in the US, a gauge of real yields, was around 2% in 2004 and 2005?currently it?s 0.7%. And because interest rates are so low, equity valuations are extended. Even the ultra-conservative Bank for International Settlements, discussing high equity valuations in its December 2017 Quarterly Review, said that while valuations were high, they ?looked far less frothy when compared with bond yields.?', 'The spoiler, of course, could be higher inflation and the January survey of global fund managers by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch pointed to ?inflation and bond crash? as the top tail risk for markets this year. Concerns over higher bond yields have sparked the latest equity sell-off. Inflation in the developed markets is projected to go up a bit this year, but it?s unlikely to be a game changer.', 'There is another factor we have to consider. With so much money in equity funds and exchange traded funds and with the rise of program trading, much depends on how fund flows into equities are affected. If the market continues to drop, redemptions may accelerate. How fund flows pan out will then determine the level at which the market stabilises. That is true both globally and for India, where domestic flows have been very strong in the past year.', 'Much also depends on the central banks in the developed economies and the pace at which they tighten. It is the belief that they will do nothing to spoil the liquidity-fuelled party that ignited the exuberance in the stock markets. So far, developed country central bankers have rushed to soothe the market if it so much as stubbed its toe. But the choice they face is stark: let some air out of the bubble now, or allow it to expand and face a spectacular bust later.']"

Subsequently, at the time of obtaining probate, the attesting witnesses, or one of them is required to depose to this fact.

Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, however, continues with 8.3%.', 'Returns on small savings instruments were linked to the market in 2011, and were then adjusted annually. This was done so that the interest rate on these could be pegged to the average government securities (g-secs) yield with similar maturity in the preceding year.\xa0However, since January-March 2015-16, after substantial cut in policy rates by the Reserve Bank of India, they are being reviewed  every quarter. Since then, rates have been declining gradually.', 'Meanwhile, g-sec yields have risen sharply in the past few months, and there has been a spike after the Union Budget 2018 was presented. The yields went up from 6.414% on 6 February 2016, to 7.562% on 2 February 2017.', 'There are two forces driving this change. ?First, the deficit numbers for current and the next year are higher than what was initially projected.

Now I think they have converged to a large extent. So I am not sure if immediately there will be an impact. But, if yields continue to rise, there may be some changes. But at the moment, I would say the rates have now converged and there won?t be a very large change in small savings rate,? Sivakumar said.', 'While the small savings rates may not go down further, before you make a decision on a financial product to invest in, you should compare it with the other avenues. Look at the returns that they generate and at the same time look at other parameters like taxation and liquidity. Some of the small saving schemes still fit in the portfolio of many individuals because the returns generated from them are tax free.']"

Through the B22 ETF, the government divested shares worth Rs14,500 crore. By bringing fund of funds on par with equity funds, it wants to make the divestment ETFs more accessible to the people.

None of these would qualify to be equity funds under the new Budget 2018 proposal, as none of these invest in?and solely?ETFs. Also, the underlying mutual fund schemes in all these fund of funds do not invest at least 90% of their corpuses in equity shares. Many are allowed to hold cash and or debt securities up to 35%; a condition that would disqualify all the existing fund of funds. It is only an ETF that would always invest at least 90% of its corpus in equity shares at all times.', 'The Budget further clarifies that for a mutual fund to be considered an equity fund, the minimum threshold of equity holding of 65% continues. This shows that the government has carved a special status for such fund of funds that aim to invest in ETFs; presumably divestment ETFs. Expect fund houses to launch fund of funds that invest in such divestment ETFs in future, especially since Budget 2018 also said that more such divestment ETFs are on their way.']"

It is important for the person earning the income to have life insurance, so that the income being earned in retirement is compensated in the event of death. In some cases, the retirement income may be from a pension, which may reduce on the death of the primary pensioner. Life insurance will help replace the lost pension so that the household can continue to manage its expenses. If you have financial responsibility of your children or grandchildren even in retirement, it becomes necessary to have adequate life insurance to meet their needs when you are not there to take care. Again, if you are paying off a large debt in retirement, say a house loan taken late in the earning years, you may consider an insurance policy to the extent of the outstanding loan so that your family is not left with that obligation in the event of your death.', 'Health-related costs have the highest potential to derail your retirement finances. It is good to be prepared for such expenses, even if there are no health concerns at the start of retirement. Make health costs an item you prioritize, when determining the costs to be met in retirement and the corpus you have to accumulate in your working years. Given the uncertainties associated with health and health costs, insurance is an efficient way to meet these expenses in a planned way. However, obtaining health insurance later in life may be difficult and the costs are likely to be higher as you grow older and health issues crop up. One way is to lock yourself into a health insurance policy when you are healthy, so that you are not rejected on grounds of health conditions, or the existing conditions are excluded, or you are charged a prohibitively high premium when you may need insurance. Do this as preparation for retirement even when you are covered by an employer-provided insurance in your working years. Select the insurance policy that takes care of your specific health needs. For example, if there are existing health conditions, then look for policies that have a lower cooling-off or exclusion period, or that may cover pre-existing conditions with lower cooling-off period with a co-payment option. If you need procedures such as dialysis, which require day-stays in hospital, then look for policies that cover multiple hospital admissions of less than 24 hours. Use top-ups and riders to make the most cost-effective and suitable health package for your needs. Personal accident insurance is something you need to consider if you intend to contribute to retirement income, with a second career in retirement. In the event of an accident, such policies compensate you for the period you are unable to work and earn an income, and to meet any out-of-pocket expenses that may not be covered by your broader health insurance policy. Long-term care is another area of old age that falls under the health-needs umbrella. Make sure your corpus provides for the costs associated with providing care and assistance at the stage when you may not be able to take care of all daily-living activities on your own.', 'Life insurance can be a tool for estate planning and managing the costs related to end of life. Life insurance policies can be used as a means to transfer wealth to the next generation, for individuals with a low risk appetite. Premiums are paid through the life of the insured and on their death, the proceeds go to the beneficiaries. Insurance policies allow the person to plan the bequeaths well ahead, accumulate the wealth over a long term and pass on the corpus. There are tax benefits at the time of paying the premiums and the corpus is tax-free too. This boosts the returns from this source, as compared to other investments that are typically used to accumulate wealth for the next generation, such as securities and real estate; where there may be capital gains and other taxes. Remember, life insurance should be part of the overall wealth transfer strategy and should be used in conjunction with other assets. The proceeds from a life insurance policy provide stability and liquidity to the inheritance while the other assets may be illiquid and have volatile values. The effectiveness of using life insurance for inheritance planning will also depend on the cost of the cover. To get the best premiums, it is important to plan ahead and make an early entry into insurance products. Make sure that you don?t overreach. If the premiums are too high for your retirement income to bear, you may not be able to service the policy and lose the benefit for which you have paid for. Another use of life insurance policy is to meet expenses related to care and medical expenses not covered by health insurance at the end of a person?s life. The beneficiaries of the policy will be responsible for meeting these expenses as they arise, and on the death of the person they will be compensated from the proceeds from the policy.', 'You need insurance to protect your assets. This includes auto insurance to compensate for any damage to your vehicle, along with third-party liability coverage to protect you from any claims against you as a result of a motor accident. A third-party liability insurance is essential to ensure that your other assets are not put at risk by a liability claim, and it is also mandatory for motor vehicles. Your home, typically your biggest asset in retirement, requires protection that an insurance policy can provide. The contents of the house can also be insured for a small sum and should be considered to protect against theft, burglary and destruction.', 'Your need for insurance in retirement will be different from the pre-retirement stage and keep evolving through the retirement years. For example, the life insurance policy intended to protect the income for a spouse or to support a loan being paid off is no longer relevant if the spouse passes away or the loan is paid off.', 'Just as you would periodically assess your income needs and make changes to your investments accordingly, you should monitor your insurance needs periodically to ensure that you have the protection you need at the most efficient cost possible.']"

The one statement about its US business that kindles some hope is that price erosion is continuing but is beginning to level out.', 'Its management said leading generic firms are reaching a pain point and may increase prices or exit unviable products. This is consequent to unceasing price cuts extracted by the distribution channel, which has become powerful every year on the back of continuing consolidation. With more consolidation seeming less likely, the hope is that prices will at the minimum stabilize.', 'Lupin?s US business did not do too badly during the quarter but all eyes were drawn to the 65% decline in its net profit over a year ago and 51% fall sequentially. That was way more than what analysts had estimated and sent its shares plunging by 6% on Tuesday. The company blamed one-off factors. Adverse foreign exchange fluctuation caused a hit of Rs 82crore. In some quarters, this contributes to profit and in others, it causes a loss. This quarter saw both a loss and of a higher quantum. Secondly, a change in the US tax law resulted in a charge of Rs36 crore, which added to its tax liability.', 'But this was not all. Lupin?s gross profit?the profit remaining after deducting material cost from sales?declined as a percentage of sales. The decline was seen both over a year ago and sequentially. Since the US business grew sequentially, one would have thought that the margin should also have improved. Apart from the forex loss, part of which reflected here, the company said the mix could have played a role, as India?s contribution rose. But it also said that this gross margin could be considered as a base for now.', 'A lowered gross margin leaves a lower percentage to meet its other operating expenses. No wonder then that Lupin is tightening its belt, with employee costs declining and other expenses falling over a year ago. However, other expenses rose significantly sequentially, which the company mainly attributed to the forex losses that reflected here. They should, therefore, settle in the forthcoming quarters.', 'In the near term, Lupin is expecting that new launches in the US market will help it arrest price erosion and grow sales, with the focus on Solosec, a product added to its pipeline after a recent acquisition. In the longer run, investor attention will remain on the company?s ability to resolve the warning letter received for two plants. That will take time and is uncertain.', 'Lupin?s management said it is refocusing its research expenditure for the US market, giving priority to products where it can be among the top three and not pursue others. That will conserve its research spends, which are already relatively high at 12.2% of sales. That?s a pragmatic approach given the difficult market conditions in the US.', 'In the near term, Lupin needs the US market to remain stable and for a steady drip of new products from its pipeline that can contribute to higher sales growth. That would then create a robust enough gross profit which can then drive operating profit growth. While one-off factors may have laid low its profits in the third quarter, investors are likely to put expectations on hold and wait and watch how it does in the next few quarters.']"

Driving this was the 16% growth in domestic two-wheeler sales, but without an expansion in realizations, which indicates competitive pressures in the two-wheeler market.', 'Moreover, the auto industry has been faced with rising raw material costs. Hero?s raw material costs rose in absolute terms steeply when compared to a year back. They rose by 250 basis points as a percentage to sales in spite of higher volumes clocked and the benefits of operating leverage.', 'This dragged the operating margin down by 100 basis points year-on-year to 15.9%, although it was what the Street had expected. The quarter?s operating profit grew by 7.3% to Rs1,158 crore. Mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio, however, translated into lower other income, which in turn impacted net profit growth. The Rs805 crore net profit therefore was a tad lower than forecasts and 4.3% higher year-on-year.', 'Hero?s shares fell by 2.5% on Tuesday, which was largely due to the fall in the overall market. Otherwise, it is on a better wicket both in terms of growth and valuation among two-wheeler makers. While Bajaj Auto Ltd?s shares trade at about 20 times one- year forward earnings, TVS Motor Co. Ltd?s trade at 32 times. Hero is comparatively cheap at about 18 times. According to Bharat Gianani, research analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, ?Rising rural demand and strong budgetary focus on rural spend will boost motorcycle sales. So, FY2019 is likely to witness another year of double-digit growth in two-wheelers. As market leader in the segment with strong rural focus, Hero should continue to clock good sales.?', 'That optimism seems to be borne out by the strong sales growth of about 31% in January. The only dampener for the stock could be sticky profitability if competitive pressures are high and input costs rise further.']"

However, he said equity investors are unlikely to shift their funds to gold partially also due to the weaker currency. ?It is too early to say if investors will migrate to gold investment due to corrections in equities. Whenever there is a volatility in equities, gold becomes attractive,? Narne added. Madhavi Mehta, an analyst at Kotak Commodity Services, said that overall interest in gold was low last year due to rising equity markets, but the market decline is unlikely to drive interest in the precious metal.', 'According to the World Gold Council?s (WGC) 6 FebruaryGold Demand Trendsreport, gold demand rallied in the closing months of 2017, gaining 6% year-on-year in Q4 to reach 1,095.8 tonnes, but overall demand for the full year fell by 7% to 4,071.7 tonnes, compared with 2016. In 2017, India?s gold demand grew by 9.1% to 727 tonnes from 666 tonnes in the previous year. In the December quarter, demand was up 2% to 249 tonnes, and within that, jewellery demand reached the highest fourth quarter level that WGC saw in 17 years.

It is a combination of fundamental factors that have turned negative, coupled with excess supply of g-secs that is causing the yield to remain high.\xa0According to Ajay Manglunia, co-head, fixed income advisory, Edelweiss Financial Services, ?With crude oil prices moving up last year, there is concern that inflation may rise and there is no certainty where crude prices may pause. Second, in the US, it is expected that rate hikes will be more aggressive this year. Bond traders are already sitting on losses and have no appetite to buy more in this market environment.?', 'Crude oil prices touched a high of around $70 per barrel (Brent Crude), up from around $45  in July 2017. This fast-paced rise in crude prices has been a cause for concern as India imports around 70% of its crude oil requirement, and higher prices are not only going to increase the import bill but also fuel price rise in other goods and services that use fuel.', 'While there is no certain way to predict how crude oil prices will move, the other two components?domestic inflation and supply side issues?may be easier to resolve.', 'According to Shankar Raman, head-third party products and investment advisory, Centrum Capital Ltd: ?Bond markets can get a positive surprise if Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues stabilises in the coming months and food price-based inflation is managed well through supply management, implementation of direct debit for farmers and minimising crop wastage. On the technical side, the bond supply issue could be tackled by making available a defined block of Indian (government) securities for foreign institutional investors.?', 'Bond markets are nervous right now. How yields move in the coming weeks will depend a lot how change in inflation data impacts RBI?s neutral stance going forward. If inflation moves significantly above RBI?s estimated 5.1% level, then it may have to shift focus to managing inflation over growth, which will be a substantial risk for bond markets.', 'In December 2017,MintMoney had cautioned that investors in various fixed-income securities needed to lower their return expectations (read ithere).', 'Despite rising yields, corporate bonds are not seeing much transactional activity; hence debt fund accrual yields haven?t benefitted yet.', 'According to Manglunia, ?For g-secs, the supply is constant and yields have been rising, but activity on the corporate bond side is subdued. Corporates are not ready to accept that these rates will sustain and prefer to wait and watch before coming to the market. Moreover, the gap in yield?between market borrowing and bank borrowing?is lower now, making the latter a preferred choice at the moment.?', 'Dynamic bond funds are already seeing a shift towards lower duration. Median duration in the dynamic bond category had dropped from 5.79 years in June 2017 to 4.37 years at the end of December 2017 and is expected to be even lower for the January-end portfolios. This potentially reduces marked-to-market risk and makes returns less volatile, at least for the time being.', 'On the deposit side, private banks had already hiked their base rates by 5-10 basis points in January this year, signalling a marginal increase in deposit rates.\xa0A trend confirmed by senior bankers speaking atMint?s Annual Banking Conference that took place on 6 February 2018.', 'Given this yield move in the 10 year g-sec of over 100 basis points in 6 months, is there a contrary opportunity to buy into this correction in the bond market?', 'This is unlikely as trading losses are already present and market participants are wary of taking fresh positions. Retail investors in any case need to stay away from such short-term opportunistic moves as timing an entry and exit is not easy for them. For your strategic medium-term debt allocation, short-term bond funds are still the most appropriate tool on a 3-year post-tax basis.', 'The negative sentiment in the bond market has now spilled over to equities too. The biggest impact can come from inflationary expectations. According to Nishant Agrawal, head - advisory family office, ASK Wealth Management, ?Stock prices were overvalued and these negative macro factors coming together have meant that the long-awaited correction is a reality now. While inflation is a worry now, in the medium- to long-term, it is unlikely to impact the stock market negatively.?', 'If rates were to go up,  it will also have a negative impact on corporate margins and earnings expectations will start to get lowered. This in turn will affect the expectation on equity-market returns negatively.\xa0Last, with global quantitative easing getting reversed gradually, the liquidity-driven rally in global equity markets is expected to slowdown its pace. Higher bond yields will also see a share of institutional money getting shifted out of equity. All this will have an impact of slowing down the pace of equity market returns for the time being.', 'Be ready for the risk, and hence volatility in equity returns, but don?t shift your long-term equity allocation. This remains an asset class that will continue to beat inflation in the long term, helping you to create wealth.', 'Raman said, ?At the moment, we are neutral on both equity and debt, but on the equity side what is true for the US is not so for India. Here we are very clearly settled into a better macro framework. Lower sustainable interest rates and inflation level can mean a sustained higher price-to-earning (P-E) rating in equity. Current valuations though are beyond that level and markets could very well remain range bound till earnings recover.?', 'So, what should you do? Reduce risk in your debt allocation and keep to accrual funds; at the same time sit tight on your long-term equity allocation but be aware of the short-term risk.']"

In January 2009, when bitcoin was first created and launched, the idea was to use it as an alternative to fiat currency. The idea was to use it for making payments and transactions. However, by 2016 and 2017, the approach shifted from it being an alternative currency to it being an investment asset.

While Cipla Ltd can?t say it was an exception, it is relatively better off than some of its peers. But the pricing pressure in the US market has led to Cipla adjusting its research spending pattern. It will use its research budget (expensed in the profit and loss account) for its generic products and use acquisitions to take forward its ambitions in the speciality product space.', 'That shift is a nod to the fact that a slower-than-expected US market sales growth could lead to research as a proportion of sales to increase faster. While this separation may help R&D as a percentage of sales to remain in check, the capital required (debt or equity) will put pressure on other parts of its profit and loss account, such as amortization or interest costs. But by focusing on late-stage candidates for acquisition, Cipla hopes to improve the odds of the product reaching market.', 'The company?s US market sales grew by 2% to $100 million over a year ago and rose by 5% sequentially. This was despite new launches in the quarter and price erosion in other products pulling down growth. If its new products continue to ramp-up and it succeeds in getting some more key approvals, growth could improve. In India, sales recovered as the market returned to normalcy post-GST (goods and services tax) roll-out. Sales growth in South Africa was healthy too.', 'Although Cipla?s overall sales grew by a relatively low 7.6%?10% adjusting for accounting effects of GST in India?it managed to do well on other fronts. Its gross profit margin (gross profit represents what is left over after deducting material costs from sales) improved, both over a year ago and sequentially. The company said a better product mix and favourable geographic share helped. It cautioned this could dip in the fourth quarter by a bit. It also kept employee costs and other expenses in check. As a result,  its operating profit rose by 20.8% over a year ago.', 'While Cipla?s relatively low sales growth is a dampener, the good showing on other fronts should comfort investors. However, it had to write down part of its acquisition of InvaGen, which cut into its net profit, and it rose by a mere 4.8% over a year ago. The company?s US business remains the key factor to watch, with a number of products in the pipeline.', 'That Cipla does not have any regulatory issues at its plants is a significant differentiator, as there are no impediments to launching these products once it gets approval.

This is a big blow for the so-called IT bulls, who are pricing in significant acceleration in growthfor leading companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).', 'Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients last month that the TCS stock is pricing in 12-13% revenue growth for as many as seven years, and that too, at stable profitability. The company?s growth is estimated to be around 7% in this fiscal year, which means growth needs to jump by about five percentage points in the next year at the minimum.', 'TCS shares have corrected by less than 5% since Kotak?s note, which means its valuations are still pricing in a huge jump in growth.', 'Cognizant?s chief executive officer Francisco D?Souza said on a call with investors that he doesn?t see any meaningful difference in the demand outlook between the beginning of 2017 and 2018. In both years, the company?s growth guidance is similar at 8-10%. ?The visibility is the same as last year,? he said.', 'The company?s guidance for the March quarter, too, suggests a soft start to the year. Adjusted for currency tailwinds, growth is expected to be between 0.6% and 1.6%, points out the above-mentioned analyst. This means that the asking growth rate is fairly high in subsequent quarters, he adds.', 'Cognizant?s shares, meanwhile, jumped as much as 6% in early trading on the Nasdaq, thanks to its bullish guidance on margins. The company has tightened its belt considerably after an intervention by activist investor Elliot Management Corp. a year ago.', 'Apart from reporting higher margins, Cognizant has also raised dividend payouts, resulting in greater return to its shareholders. Indian companies such as TCS, on the other hand, are struggling to hold margins because of pricing pressure in the traditional services segment.', 'As such, the rally in Cognizant shares is nothing that Indian IT stocks can take comfort in.

In comparison, shares of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (that runs the IndiGo airline) trade at about 17 times FY19?s estimated earnings.', 'But firm crude oil prices are a looming threat in the near future.

Even better, it matched analysts? revenue and profit expectations.', 'Although the stock rose by 1.6% on Thursday on favourable news and a positive mood on the Street, it may be too early to rejoice. After all order flows are lumpy in this sector and the third quarter accretion maybe a flash in the pan. On a cumulative basis, the nine-month order flow of Rs15,750 crore in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) is sharply lower when compared to the year-ago period. Therefore, Bhel would have to ramp-up orders in the fourth quarter to be able to sustain order flow growth and keep the order book at the current level of Rs1.02 trillion.', 'All this fuss about order flows is justified given that the company has steadily seen revenue falling (see chart) due to poor orders coming in from the power sector, which accounts for about 80% of its revenue. Moreover, a year back, a significant portion of the company?s order book was slow-moving.', 'After notching up Rs47,963 crore in FY12, Bhel?s annual revenue steadily declined to Rs28,222 crore in FY17, leading to a fall in profits and drop in the stock price that consistently underperformed benchmark indices.', 'So, the 5% year-on-year jump in net revenue during the December quarter that along with stringent cost-control measures translated into an operating profit growth of 32% was a welcome change. This was in spite of a 53% jump in other expenses that was due to higher one-time provisioning.', 'Further, the management (in the conference call) appeared confident of raking in strong orders in the current quarter, which should see the year pull through a strong order book at the end of FY18.', 'In fact, Bhel?s stock performance would hinge largely on order flows in the forthcoming quarters. Will the power sector that is weighed down with overcapacity dish out large orders for firms such as Bhel? If not, will the government take steps to resuscitate this behemoth by a strategic shift into new areas?', 'Another critical factor is the company?s profitability. The December quarter?s operating margin of 4.5% came nearly 100 basis points higher than the year-ago period, but has not been consistently improving. Large orders that got stuck for want of liquidity or clearances or even stalled projects, can adversely impact the profit margin.', 'In other words, consistent order flows and profitability are the need of the hour for investors to gain confidence in Bhel. At Rs95, the stock trades at about 19 times estimated FY19 earnings, which although expensive may look reasonable if the company can ramp- up net profit as it did in the December quarter.']"

Ltd, Singapore, said in an interview. But he pointed out that the equity sell-off does not change the big picture, which is that the widespread global growth is intact. ?After almost half a decade of negative surprises, since June 2017 there has been the positive earnings surprise?further more than two-thirds of S&P 500 companies that have declared results to-date, have beaten the consensus forecasts,? Guglani said.', 'With the Indian markets too in a free fall, mirroring global trends, Guglani said that the BSE blowout does not change the country?s economic outlook. ?India continues to be the fastest growing large economy, the impact of structural reforms unleashed by the Modi government will be evident in the coming quarters, and the demographic dividend is still intact,? he added.', 'Edited excerpts:', 'There has been meltdown in equity markets globally. Do you think this is start of another financial crisis?', 'For those worrying about potential financial crisis, may we point out that for a significant financial crisis the meltdown should be in multiple asset classes. We do not see the rout in equity being mirrored in the fixed-income market. The G-spread (i.e. the spread between corporate bonds and government bonds) has not widened significantly. There would be a bit of rub-off impact wherein investors would sell in fixed income market to fund equity losses, but it is unlikely to be significant by itself.', '', 'The equity market correction was long overdue. We had seen 310 consecutive days of stock market rise without a correction of more than 3%, which is the longest streak since 1980. Technically, the correction could take the market to its trend line, which is further down by about 6% for S&P 500 Index, and which is also close to its long-term support - 200-days moving average.', 'However, given the sharp fall in prices, the technical indicators have already hit the oversold zone. Hence, there could be dead cat bounce, within a day or two; with market falling (again) after that.', 'The equity sell-off does not change the big picture, which is that the widespread global growth is intact.

This is the first time in history of mankind that we have passive funds?ETF, Trackers, Index Funds, etc.?larger than active funds. Most of the passive funds are algorithmic, driven by looking in the rear-view mirror, that is, based on history?whether few (nano) seconds or few hours or few days?hence are predominantly, trend driven. The Index goes up, so you buy Index ETF, which buys more of the index stocks, which pushes up the Index, and there you have a virtual cycle. The same happens on the downside, with more velocity since you don?t need to put moneys on the table to sell and stop-losses trigger massive trades. Humanity is witnessing the after effects of the largest ever misallocation of capital through pump-priming of central banks.', 'Is this drop in global equity a flash crash?', 'The current meltdown is further accentuated by massive increase in volatility (VIX) trading. The amount of investment (AUM) in volatility (VIX) related products shot from $2 billion to over $5 billion in the past five years.', '', 'The VIX, which was stagnating around 10 for several months spiked to over 35 practically overnight.

While the fiscal leeway in the 2018 budget is not significant, oil and inflation need to be watched. Given accelerated adoption of alternative fuels globally, US becoming significant producer of crude at 10 million barrels a day ?with shale gas break even below $50 bbl, etc? we do not see a major spike in oil price. Inflation would see a seasonal uptick with the onset of summer and pulled-up by increase in MSP (minimum support price) of agricultural products. According to the RBI study the impact of increase in MSP on inflation is much lower since, despite 150 products being under MSP, the market price is lower than MSP only in handful of cases and active intervention is required sporadically for a few of those. Further, the agility of the Modi government in using food grain reserves and imports has made food price spikes very muted. From investor perspective, given the vast diversity of the Indian economy, it would be preferable to diversify much more through Silverdale Fund of Indian Equity Funds.', 'In view of equity meltdown, do you think US Fed would continue with its guided rate hike?', 'We continue to expect Fed rate hike in March 2018, despite theBloombergexpectation having fallen from 99% in January end to 80% (Feb 6, 2018) in less than one week. Typically, the market prices the fed rate hike before the actual hike. Given the strong uptick in payroll data, the market has priced-in March 2018 rate hike as well as increased the probability of three rate hikes in 2018. We believe the strong uptick in US non-farm payroll to 200,000?against consensus of 180,000?is due to idiosyncratic factors, and shall get normalized in the next month data release. Since US Federal Bank has embarked upon marginal rate hikes with tightening of the balance-sheet ?i.e. stopped buying $30 billion of bonds every month?as expected the interest rates have started looking up. The 10-year treasury broke the minor resistance level towards the upper bound of 30-years channel, which resulted in 10-year treasury yield spike.', 'As a bond fund manager, any change in your investment strategy?', 'We continue to focus on short dated, emerging market, investment-grade names which has historically played well for us (2017 return to investor: 9.02%). We look to add high-conviction names during such times of turmoil and market dislocation. While we did expect increase in volatility, it came in a bit too quick; however, our discipline in bond quality selection and our tactical view of keeping higher amount of dry gunpowder?unutilized credit limit?has put us in an advantageous position.']"
