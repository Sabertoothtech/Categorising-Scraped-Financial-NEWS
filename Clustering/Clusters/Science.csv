Scientists have said that actinorhodins could now be the basis of a new antibiotic drug.', 'With modern-day diseases becoming increasingly resistant to existing drugs, biological scientists and chemists at Leeds are now re-examining these old compounds, applying advances in science and technology to test more precisely whether they could still hold the key to a future drug.', '?At the time scientists did not fully differentiate the individual compounds within the family when they examined them, leading to a less than precise picture of their properties. This prompted my team to divide the family and select a specific compound (y-ACT) for further evaluation, using an array of 21st century approaches, to assess its potential and to understand how it works against bacteria,? Alex O?Neill, professor at from the Antimicrobial Research Centre at the University of Leeds, said.', 'O?Neill and colleague professor Chris Rayner from the University?s School of Chemistry have published their findings in the journalScientific Reports, and believe the compound is worth serious consideration as the basis for a new drug to combat certain types of bacterial infections.', '?y-ACT exhibits potent antibacterial activity against two important representatives of the ESKAPE class of pathogens, which are bacteria that have developed the ability to ?escape? the action of existing drugs. A major challenge in tackling the problem of antibiotic resistance is to discover new drugs?our study shows that potentially useful drug candidates can be ?discovered? from amongst the antibiotics we already know about,? O?Neill said.', '?The weak activity previously published for the ACT family as a whole probably explains why this group was not further evaluated, and it is intriguing to think that other potentially useful antibiotic groups are languishing in obscurity in academic journals just needing expert review using modern processes and equipment,? he said.', 'Scientists have said that by studying compounds which have antibacterial properties, as shown by past research, there is scope to fast-track the challenging early stages of drug discovery.', 'Interestingly, on similar lines, another research of Michael Webb from School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, focused on a compound called pentyl pantothenamide, first assessed in the 1970s. Then, it was found to be able to stop the growth of E.coli bacteria but not completely kill the bacteria, so was never taken into clinical use.', 'At the time, scientists did not understand how it was able to stop the growth, but Webb and his team have proved it is driven by Vitamin B5, which is used to metabolise energy. Bacteria have to make B5 and a key part of the machinery they use to do so is called the PanDZ complex.', 'Pentyl pantothenamide targets the PanDZ complex, preventing E.coli from making Vitamin B5 and so starving it of the means to grow. ?The results of our latest study open up the possibility of designing new drugs that use the same means to attack E. coli, but in a more effective way,? said Webb.', '?Until recently, no new antibiotics had been discovered for 25 years. O?Neill?s research is important: it?s providing another way of looking for potential antibiotics and could hold the key to uncovering options that were overlooked before but may be incredibly useful now,? he said.']"

An investigation found that Rajendra Kumar, an unqualified medical practitioner or quack, had used a single syringe on poor patients, promising cheap treatment.', 'Such incidents are not uncommon in India. In a similar incident, in 2011, at least 28 children suffering from thalassemia (a blood disorder) were allegedly infected with HIV in a hospital in Junagadh, Gujarat, following blood transfusion.', 'The National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) on Monday sent a team to Unnao to study the situation and submit its report to the central health ministry by the end of this week.', 'Experts say India is beset by a wide range of problems in healthcare delivery.

WHO says that the move can eliminate  avoidable deaths and infections from reusable syringes and unsafe injection.', 'Some countries such as Uganda and Tanzania have banned unqualified medical practitioners and private sector from access to disposable syringes. India is yet to adopt this practise on a national scale. However some hospitals?public and private?do use auto-disable syringes.', '?This (Unnao cases) could be just the tip of the iceberg as the problem is spread across the country. With more than 40,000 quacks in Delhi alone reusing syringes constitutes one of their main unsafe practices. It is urgently needed to introduce Universal Infection Prevention (UIP) guidelines including urgent deployment of auto disable syringes to limit infections from spreading,? said Rajiv Nath, president, All India Syringes and Needles Manufacturers Association (AISNMA).', '?India currently has no tracking of infections or registry via public healthcare from reuse of syringes or needles or needle stick injuries. According to WHO, every $1 spent on injection safety saves $14 in public healthcare,? said Nath.', 'A 2016 study by the department of health research under the health ministry found that auto-disable syringes cost only Rs1.90 each.', '?Bringing in AD syringes is largely a government and policy matter and we don?t have much role in this,? said Alok Saxena, joint secretary, Naco. ?We are running several programs for injection safety.

But as the restrictions gather pace, it?s becoming increasingly clear that nobody has a precise handle on vital data showing if the measures are working. There isn?t even agreement or consistency as to what to constitutes a single-use plastic bag: governments and agencies often use different thicknesses in their definitions.', '?No one can tell you on a global level if we are making progress on the amount of plastic that ends up in the ocean,? says Rob Opsomer, systemic initiatives lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity promoting the reuse and recycling of materials.', 'The plastic bag?s ascent to ubiquity is in stark contrast to its humble beginnings. Made from a material that was invented by accident in the 1930s, it wasn?t until 1962 that the first patent of what we now think of as a plastic bag emerged. Its rise from there was meteoric, with the patent approved for a company called Celloplast in 1965, before being brought into the mass market by chemical businesses like Mobil.', 'Still, small-scale data sets suggest restrictions do work. For example, curbs in Wales and Northern Ireland appeared to cut usage in those countries by about 80% between 2010 and 2014, according to WRAP, a group that monitored usage for the UK government over that period. While it appears success then spread across the UK, Defra, the government department that took over monitoring, counted bag usage differently to WRAP.', 'Either way, such studies don?t provide a global picture. Retailers in England covered by a government charge supplied 2.1 billion single-use bags in the year to April 2017, according to Defra. That?s 0.6% of the 330 billion single-use plastic bags that the The Ellen MacArthur Foundation reckons are used globally annually. The data for Northern Ireland and Wales account for just 0.03% of worldwide consumption.', 'The European Union has a target of using 90 bags per person by the end of 2019, or 46 billion based on its current population. The European Commission, which previously said better data are needed, estimates that approximately 100 billion were used in 2016.', 'One way to get a handle on the usage of bags is to monitor the consumption of the type of plastic that?s used to make them. That?s a category of high-density polyethylener?HDPE for short?known as film and sheet. IHS Markit Inc., which compiles figures in its annual Polyethylene World Analysis Report, sees the overall category continuing to expand.', '?Under our current view we continue to see year over year global demand growth in the film and sheet category globally,? says Joel Morales Jr., executive director of Polyolefins Americas at IHS. That?s because the growth of the middle class in high population countries like India and China will continue to be a boon for plastics demand, he said.', 'Measures to curb the use of single-use bags are also partly offset by people switching to thicker, more plastic-intensive bags, as highlighted in a 2014 review of a ban imposed by Australia?s Capital Territory. While those are usually designed to be reused and recycled, it highlights the importance of clear data and well-defined objectives in improving the way we consume plastic.', 'And all the while, bags are a tiny subset of the plastics industry. Sacks and bags made of ethylene represented less than 10% of plastics imported into the US in 2016, according to the Plastics Industry Association. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that plastic bags make up just 3% of plastic usage globally. And given how little we know about the number of bags out there, producing data for the remaining 97% of plastic consumption is going to be a growing problem as governments try and manage their use.', '?One of the elements we need going forward is to have a much better body of evidence, understanding and transparency on what plastic usage is,? Opsomer said. ?We need to have that evolving year on year, as we can on climate.?Bloomberg']"
