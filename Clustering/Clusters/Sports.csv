So let?s say it for him: ?Your contribution as coach and mentor to the Under-19 World Cup winning team was just fantastic.?', 'This is the fourth time India have won the title in the last two decades. Coaches in the past?Roger Binny and Dav Whatmore, among them?have left their mark too. So what makes Dravid?s tenure distinctive?', 'Some part of this can be gauged by the emphatic manner of the U-19 team triumph this year. In every match, India looked several notches above their rivals, and in every department of the game.', 'The semi-final and final, hypothetically the two toughest games, ended up becoming totally one-sided contests not because the opponents were weak, but because India?s players were able to raise their performance a couple of notches.', 'In the semi-final, Pakistan were dismissed for 69, leaving India victors by 203 runs. In the final, Australia were in a fairly strong position at 183-4 (40th over) but were bundled out for a modest 216, which India overhauled without ado.', 'The manner in which India played these two key matches was quite fascinating. It was almost as if a juggernaut was at work. Several players came to the fore with outstanding efforts, individually and collectively.', 'The adrenalin level was high, which was to be expected given the title was now within grasp. But this didn?t come at the expense of sound cricket logic. There was no sense of false bravado.', 'In the final, particularly, the run chase seemed all easy. But as is only too well known, modest targets can be deceptive, leading to a false sense of complacency and misplaced heroics that can cost dear.', 'India?s response was measured and immaculate. The emphasis was on processes?not sentiment?that would lead to triumph. There was no excitability or attempt to gallop to the target in, say, 25-30 overs. It was reached comfortably in 38.5.', 'The team?s approach reflected Dravid?s own to the game: about maintaining balance without sacrificing flair. But his larger impact has perhaps to do with more than just providing technical insights about how to bat, bowl and field.', 'It?s teaching players to cope with the life challenges of being a cricketer. In the Indian context, since the game is so massive, this is even more pronounced, and therefore of paramount importance.', 'Cricketers enjoy a stellar position in Indian life today. The mass appeal of the game can make them instant stars and provide fame and riches, often beyond their wildest imagination.', 'For example, five members of the current U-19 team?Prithvi Shaw, Shubman Gill, Shivam Mavi, Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Anukul Roy?got multi-crore-rupee contracts in the recent Indian Premier League auctions.', 'But such extraordinary privileges also make Indian cricketers, especially the young, vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the game and life. Not every player will make it big. Not every player who has made it big will be able to sustain this position for various reasons.', 'While almost 50% of the current Indian team?Tests and limited overs?has players who have graduated from the Under-19 ranks (which actually bespeaks of the robust grass-roots work done by the Board of Control for Cricket in India), there are no guarantees.', 'Consider the stories of three captains who have led India to the Under-19 World Cup title. Mohammad Kaif had middling success as an international player, Virat Kohli has zoomed skywards in double quick time, while Unmukt Chand?s career has yet to take off.', 'It is interesting that Dravid opted to be with India?s youngsters rather than the senior team at this point?essentially to maintain a work-life balance, but also because he believed this assignment was more demanding and would give him greater satisfaction.', 'How to cope with success and failure, keep focus on the game and not just its rewards, understand one?s own strength and weaknesses as well as those of others?teammates and rivals?are some things best learnt young in competitive sport.', 'Dravid?s sensibilities and vast experience would have been invaluable for the young guns as they grow into the bigger arena, of cricket and life.

Most have just languished in domestic cricket or disappeared from the field,"['Almost a decade ago, a World Cup victory changed the profile of the Under-19 format in India after Virat Kohli caught the imagination of the cricketing community as a precocious talent.', 'However, in that tournament (played in Malaysia in 2008), it was not Kohli (235 runs in six games) but Kanpur?s Tanmay Srivastava (262 runs in six matches) who was the highest scorer for the team.', 'Srivastava had made his first-class debut (against a strong Rest of India which had the likes of Zaheer Khan and Lakshmipathy Balaji, among others) ahead of Kohli. After Kuala Lumpur, however, Srivastava?s and Kohli?s paths took entirely different turns.', 'While Kohli, with 325 international games across formats, has established himself as one of our all-time greats, Srivastava was ignored by his home state Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy last season after playing 81 first-class matches.', '?Every now and then people taunt me, saying, ?Viratkahan hai aur tum kahan ho(look at where Virat is and where youare),?? says the 28-year-old, who has also played for three teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the last 10 years.', '', 'Srivastava is not the only one from the U-19 format who has failed to graduate to international cricket. Apart from Kohli, only three players (K.L. Rahul, Jaydev Unadkat and Kuldeep Yadav) have managed to play for India in all formats from the last four batches of U-19 World Cup teams (Ravindra Jadeja was part of the 2008 U-19 team too but he had played the 2006 U-19 final as well).', 'Among the remaining 56 players, just seven have managed to play 32 Twenty20 matches?these include four ?lucky? ones who have represented India in 29 One Day Internationals, or ODIs (though Manish Pandey alone has played 22).', 'To put it simply, the strike rate of conversion to international cricket is poor. For every Kohli, there is the depressing tale of an Unmukt Chand (the captain of the 2012 triumph, and was the highest scorer in Australia). Ironically, Chand, 24, was unsold in the recent IPL auction and is not a regular in the Delhi Ranji team either.', '?I will share from my experience,? says Srivastava, while watching Prithvi Shaw?s team in the final at his Ghaziabad home on Saturday.', '', '?At this level (U-19), everything looks so easy. However, after that your responsibility increases in first-class cricket. One game is in windy and chilly Dharamsala. The next is in the oppressive heat of Chennai and then in Cuttack. Apart from mastering different conditions, you need to keep clearing all the hurdles in the next two years because if you fail to do that, it quickly derails,? says the UP opener.', '?It?s not necessary that every U-19 player will graduate to Ranji or country,? says former India player Venkatesh Prasad, who also heads the junior selection committee. ?It?s all about mental maturity and how they handle themselves (after initial success). The others who are not part of the World Cup team are playing somewhere and they are also maturing and will compete.?', 'Over the past decade, stories of failure among U-19 players have generally blamed selectors, the temptation of glamour and money from the IPL, or injuries at the wrong time.', 'Spinner Iqbal Abdulla and pacer Siddharth Kaul were joint-highest wicket takers, along with Jadeja, from the 2008 team but they just kept floating in the Ranji Trophy and IPL. Shahbaz Nadeem, who played in the 2006 tournament, still wonders why he didn?t make it to India A, forget India, despite being the highest wicket taker in Ranji Trophy (in 2016-17).', 'Srivastava likens the Ranji to a quagmire, saying it?s easy if you keep climbing but tough if you get stuck for a season or two. Quoting Kohli?s example, he says, ?Virat soon got the Border-Gavaskar scholarship and India A and then India...?', '?Chadte suraj ko sab salaam karte hain(everyone salutes the rising sun) but few will support you when you are injured or struggling,? recalls former India player Reetinder Singh Sodhi, who was part of the first World Cup winning team in 2000 that also had the likes of Mohammad Kaif and Yuvraj Singh.', 'Cheteshwar Pujara, Rohit Sharma, Jadeja and Piyush Chawla have emerged from the team of 2006 that lost in the World Cup final. Half-a-dozen players from the 2004 team also made it to the national team. But two of them, Abhishek Sharma (the highest wicket taker with 12 scalps) and Praveen Gupta (11 wickets), faded away quickly.', 'Similarly, Ravneet Ricky and Shalabh Srivastava (the highest scorer and wicket taker, respectively, from the 2000 champion team), Manvinder Bisla and another Abhishek Sharma (the highest scorer and wicket taker, respectively, from the 2002 team) could never come close to national reckoning.', 'Similar patterns were observed in 2010 (Mayank Aggarwal and Saurabh Netravalkar), 2012 (Unmukt Chand and Ravikant Singh) and 2016 (Sarfaraz Khan and Avesh Khan), with those most successful with the bat and ball failing to make it to the next grade.', 'So, is there a message for Shubman Gill (372 runs in six matches) and Anukul Roy (14 wickets in six matches) from the 2018 triumphant team?', '?Many players from our group (the 2004 team) and Virat?s group played for India. My advice to these youngsters is to play as many games, even corporate games. The next two-three years are crucial but, honestly, I believe in three-four years? time, the whole team can play for India,? says Suresh Raina, 31, who has just made a comeback to India?s T20 squad, which will play three matches against South Africa this month.', '?This is good for recognition but now the pressure of expectation also kicks in. It can be like candy floss if they start basking in this glory,? warns Sodhi.', '?Coping with the rigours of senior cricket won?t be easy. Now players will be physically stronger and more mature and it?s a different challenge altogether,? adds Prasad.', 'Shikhar Dhawan, who was senior to Kohli, almost lost his way before making a stunning comeback in 2013 almost a decade after his U-19 glory.', 'Manish Pandey was Kohli?s teammate in 2008 and scored an IPL 100 in South Africa in 2009. Stuart Binny managed to play in every format after wandering for 12 years in the domestic circuit. He was part of the 2002 junior team which had the likes of Irfan Pathan and Parthiv Patel in its ranks.', '?How much maturity does a player have at the U-19 level, in comparison to a 24-, 28- or  32-year-old, whom they will face in Ranji? They start doubting their ability once they see failure at the next level. He will start questioning if he is really good enough,? explains Prasad, who was head coach of the 2006 junior team which lost the final against Pakistan.', 'Another peculiar issue this generation faces is the double-edged sword of the IPL. The arguments from both sides are equally compelling on the positive and negative effects of the game?s most influential format.', '?I don?t think the IPL is a distraction or a bad thing. It?s an opportunity to express. Also, they have got the best coach in Rahul Dravid, whose words and guidance will keep them grounded,? says Raina.', '?The IPL is an advantage, it can rescue you. For eight first-class matches, you need to work for eight months, while the IPL gives you everything (in seven weeks). Nowadays, you get a T20 and ODI cap after a fabulous IPL,? says Srivastava.', '?The IPL auction (27-28 January) happened before the Pakistan game (30 January) and that is why Gill got just Rs1.8 crore, else he could have got Rs11 crore. The rules have changed and uncapped players get so much. This is good, but is too much money good for players? I bought an LML Vespa after my first season but today many from this team will buy BMWs as their first vehicle. Everything has pros and cons,? says Sodhi.', 'So what is the solution? What needs to be done to ensure there are more Kohlis than Chands from U-19 teams?', '?Half of the team will be playing in the IPL but the challenge is to manage someone like Ishan Porel (who took 4/17 against Pakistan), who doesn?t have an IPL contract. That?s the time you need guidance. The NCA (National Cricket Academy) should nurture them,? advises Srivastava.', 'As coach Dravid said at the presentation ceremony, U-19 players should not look upon the World Cup as the defining moment of their careers but as a stepping stone. It has got them attention but until they keep knocking?with a good IPL, a great first-class season and sustained performances?it may not lead them to the enviable path of Kohli.', '?I still sleep every day with my India cap on my bed. How badly you value an India cap possibly will determine your journey,? concludes Sodhi.', 'Vimal Kumar is the author ofSachin: Cricketer Of The CenturyandThe Cricket Fanatic?s Essential Guide.', 'He tweets at @vimalwa']"

Edited excerpts:', 'In your book, you have mentioned that when you were going through a bad phase in life after the tennis elbow injury, you would go on early morning drives with your friends. Could you explain that?', 'There were occasions where I felt that I would not like to play again, especially after my tennis elbow surgery. It took me four-and-a-half months to get back into the action. I tried batting that time with my son?s plastic bat. I was not able to play with the plastic bat, where am I going to play with a normal bat facing balls at 90 km per hour. My friends would come with me. Sometime at 3am we would be driving. I have gone to their place and told them that come, I am waiting for you... Driving has always given me a lot of mental peace, satisfaction. Driving and music as a combination have worked really well for me. I loved those drives. On a number of occasions, my driver sits at the back and I go wherever I have to.', 'There was one video of yours that went viral where you were instructing a motorcyclist to wear helmet...', 'Road safety is extremely important. They must wear helmets. The tendency ofmujhe kucch nahi ho sakta, idhar hi toh jana hai... Even if it is 100 metres, anything can go wrong. People should not take things for granted because it is not just you who would suffer. I have noticed that so many guys have helmets put in their arms and whenever they come across a policeman, they will immediately wear them. People must realise that helmets are for their own safety.', 'Any thoughts of Indian U-19 team winning the World Cup?', 'I think it was brilliant. They outlasted everyone. They were way above the rest of the competition. This is a reflection of what BCCI has done in the last 15 years or so. It has changed the infrastructure. It is an organised system. It is well planned and well thought of and the results are showing. Smaller towns of India have also been able to produce cricketers. We have been able to take cricket to the remotest parts of India.', 'What do you think of Rahul Dravid as a coach?', 'I think he has done a fabulous job. When somebody of his stature is in the dressing room and players get to share their thoughts and their problems with him, that is always going to help and it will always reflect in the way players have played and how they have shown their character on the field.', 'For that matter, my friend, Paras Mhambrey, was instrumental.', 'How has cricket changed from the time when you started playing?', 'The game has changed completely. Earlier when we played, one-day cricket was followed more. Today, it is T20. Of course for me, Test cricket sits right on top. The rules have changed. Surfaces have changed?not in the last series... the last series was a different surface in South Africa.', 'Overall, the pitches in Australia, the way they were in the 90s and the way they are now, has changed. And that?s the case all around now. It will continue changing.', 'Are you happy with the current Indian team?', 'I think we have done well. I have always believed that we have had good balance and the team has shown. In India, we have played quite a few matches and we did well. We have travelled. In the first two matches (which India lost), I think we were in the game. Normally, you do have crunch moments in any match and if you win those crunch moments, then you end up dominating the remaining part of the match. So, South Africa won those crunch moments in the first two matches.']"
