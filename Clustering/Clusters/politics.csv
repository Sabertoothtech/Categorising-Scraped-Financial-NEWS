There is a growing acknowledgement that the formal mechanism to quit the EU, which May triggered March 29, might not allow enough time to untangle many of the sticking points.', 'On a tripto the Middle East, May was asked specifically about whether EU citizens should still have a right to come to the U.K., and vice versa, during this interim period.', '?Once we?ve got the deal, once we?ve agreed what the new relationship will be for the future, it will be necessary for there to be a period of time when businesses and governments are adjusting systems and so forth,? May told reporters as she flew to Amman on Monday.', 'Everything you need to know about Brexit explained right here.', 'This bridge -- the U.K. call it an implementation period, the EU refers to it as a transitional arrangement -- could last any number of years depending on how negotiations develop.

And to be clear on our side we will be ready to face any eventualities and all eventualities,? Barnier, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. After his words, the pound traded down by as much as 0.6 percent against the euro.', 'On the question of the financial settlement -- the most intractable of the three pressing issues -- Barnier said: ?We have reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing for thousands of project promoters in Europe and it?s disturbing also for taxpayers.?', 'Barnier noted that Prime Minister Theresa May had pledged in her speech in Florence last month that the U.K. would continue to pay into the EU budget for two years after the split.', 'He signaled disappointment that this wasn?t followed up in the negotiations this week. But in return for those payments, May wants a two-year transition period to ease the anxiety for businesses.', 'But the U.K. understood his words as an elegant cry for help from the Frenchman to the 27 European leaders, according to a person familiar with the U.K. team?s negotiating position: a plea to them to loosen up his mandate so he can start talking about the future alongside the divorce terms.', 'If true, between now and the summit a week away, signs of movement may come from the rest of the European capitals. May?s government believes the ball is still in the EU?s court -- and it is now for the other leaders to decide if they want to unlock the talks.', 'Barnier held out hope that progress could be made at a summit in December, if the U.K. fleshes out more what May alluded to in Florence less than a month ago. That will be hard in a Conservative government constantly at war with itself on the direction of Brexit -- her own chancellor was mauled by euro-skeptics for his reluctance to plow money into non-deal contingency plans.', 'Starting trade talks in December leaves less than a year to get a deal on trade and the transition. Some businesses won?t wait around to see the outcome, with banks the first taking steps to go. Crashing out of the bloc would wreak havoc on the economy, affecting flights, financial markets and pharmaceuticals and slapping tariffs on all foreign trade.', 'The U.K. is still butting against the EU?s timetable, saying it can?t sort the divorce issues, such as the U.K.?s new EU land border that will bisect the island of Ireland --- until trade talks are under way.', 'With talks showing increasing brinkmanship, Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""I make no secret of the fact that to provide certainty, we must talk about the future.?', 'The focus now turns to the summit next week of the EU?s 27 leaders. Initially trade talks were expected to start at that meeting, now the U.K. can hope for little more than encouraging words -- or chinks in the EU?s armor.', '', '', '']"

But he added that was not a guarantee.

It?s up to the Democrats but they should not be worried.""', 'Trump repeated his previously stated conditions for a immigration deal: curtailing family preferences in immigration, abolishing the visa lottery program, and building a border wall.The White House plans to release a ""legislative framework"" for an immigration plan on Monday that will address those concerns, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement earlier Wednesday.', 'Trump spoke shortly after a bipartisan group of senators met to work out a process for developing and then shepherding immigration legislation through the House and Senate, where there are deep divisions over how to address the issue. The three-day government shutdown that ended Monday helped jump-start the immigration talks.', 'Lawmakers are preparing for a likely floor debate on immigration if they can?t agree on a plan by Feb. 8, the next deadline when current government funding authority expires.', 'Second-ranking Senate Republican John Cornyn of Texas is working with No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois on a compromise solution. Cornyn said Wednesday he thinks that group will provide a ""framework"" for a bill that could move through the Senate.', 'However, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said his chamber wouldn?t be bound by any decisions made in the Senate. Any measure that moves through the House likely would have to have Trump?s firm backing.', 'Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Trump?s statement in support of a path to citizenship for DACA recipients ?will allow us to solve a difficult problem? and help get an agreement on strong border security measures.', 'Cornyn said he wants a 10-year, $25 billion border security plan, with the money possibly set aside in a trust fund, not just authorized and paid for later.', '', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Jawaharlal Nehru held office as Secretary for State (the head of government) of the Union of India throughout this period and governed the country through the Government of India Act (1935).', 'During this gradual transition phase, the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly (also the interim parliament in this period) was hard at work drafting a constitution for the infant country in the backdrop of lawlessness and bloodshed of the Partition and the beginning of the Kashmir conflict, Mahatma Gandhi?s assassination in 1948 and the complex political integration of 565 princely states with India. Nevertheless, in 1949, the Constituent Assembly finished drafting the world?s longest constitution with a solid foundation of justice, liberty, equality, unity, integrity and democracy as its leading values.', 'A historic session of the Constituent Assembly was held at the Central Hall of the Parliament House where the Constitution was passed with loud cheering and thumping of desks.', 'Before the motion and draft Constitution was passed, Dr Rajendra Prasad, the then President of the Constituent Assembly, said:', 'It was decided that India would become a truly sovereign state on 26 January 1950, the date chosen for its significance in history when in 1930, the Indian National Congress decided to demand for Purna Swaraj: complete freedom from the British.', 'Two days before the big day, on 24 January, at a special session of the Constituent Assembly, Dr Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of independent India.

One moment to be remembered from this ceremony was the riveting role reversal between two of Asia?s charismatic leaders.

It was drawn by six Australian horses along the five-mile road to the Amphitheatre, escorted by the President?s bodyguards.', 'The roads were lined with exuberant crowds with the tricolour in their hands, cheering and chanting ?Jai? joined by those peering from neighbouring building roofs and treetops. Dr Prasad greeted them all with his hands folded and a modest but beaming smile.', 'His arrival at the amphitheatre was marked by a resounding 31-gun salute, solemnising the event as a milestone in India?s ?chequered history?: Our first Republic Day celebrations as an independent nation.', 'Dr Prasad proceeded to take a round of the amphitheatre, this time in a jeep, while saluting the 3,000 armed forces that had gathered there, after which he hoisted the tricolour, our national flag for the very first time.

There were no performances or elaborate tableaus that we have come to know of today. Very few policemen guarded the VIPs inside the stadium who mingled with each other and the crowds, especially Nehru who reportedly spent close to half an hour interacting with the commonfolk.', 'Across India?s small towns and villages,prabhat pheries,or morning rounds where people came together to chant songs before the sun rose to invoke good vibrations for a new day, were organised.', 'Outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, amidst booming cheers by jubilant pools of people dressed in their finest, who had come to take part in the celebrations from adjoining states, the capital city had an air of festivity. People congratulated each other in the streets, raised slogans of ?Gandhiji ki Jai? and ?Vande Mataram? and visited Rajghat, the resting place of Mahatma Gandhi, in thousands.', 'Nearby, in Connaught Place, people of all age groups thronged the streets and crowded restaurants; shops remained illuminated through the day while the Rashtrapati Bhavan lit up at night, marking yet another first of a custom followed till this day. The atmosphere was electric and the spirit of freedom, infectious. India was the first Commonwealth country to have entirely come into its own; it was the biggest national ceremony of the 20th century.', 'Not all was good as there were several reports of anti-Republic Day celebrations from various regions across India. In Calcutta, communists attacked police officers with bombs and in Bombay, they protested that the workers? rights had been ignored in the constitution. In Hyderabad, there was an attempt to assassinate the Nizam, and in the capital city itself, the navy almost walked out of the parade!', 'Under the sea-faring British Empire, the navy was understandably the foremost of the three Armed Forces. Today, it can be argued that the honour lies with the army but in 1950, it was still a matter of contention. During the rehearsals for the first parade, the Navyfound itselfplaced after the last and comparatively huge contingent of the Army. When they protested, they were not taken seriously.', 'Until one day, during a routine rehearsal closer to 26 January, the Lt Commander and officer-in-charge of the Navy Contingent, Inder Singh, ordered the troops to march off the ground in protest. Chaos ensued and within fifteen minutes, senior army forces including the then Brigadier arrived at Irwin Amphitheatre to request the Navy to rejoin the parade, but this time in the lead. The offer was accepted, and that?s where the Navy marched on the final day.', 'From 1955 onwards, the venue of the celebrations was shifted to Rajpath, giving birth to an increasingly spectacular ceremony that remains a defining moment in the lives of all Indians each year, an event of national pride that displays the might and diversity of India: the Republic Day parade as we know it now.', 'It can be argued that the values encapsulated in the Constitution have eroded significantly in today?s political and cultural environment, in which case we need only look back at Dr Prasad?s words at the Irwin Amphitheatre 68 years ago for a glimmer of hope and rejuvenated enthusiasm: ?We must re-dedicate ourselves on this [Republic] day to the peaceful but sure realisation of the dream that had inspired the father of our nation and the other captains and soldiers of our freedom struggle, the dream of establishing a classless, co-operative, free and happy society. We must remember that this is more a day of dedications than of rejoicing ? dedication to the glorious task of making the peasants and workers, the toilers and the thinkers fully free, happy and cultured.?', '(We Indians have much to talk about these days.

But in this case, Mueller answers to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who made the decision to give the case to a special counsel. He also appointed Mueller, a former FBI director. Rosenstein?s boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself from overseeing the inquiry.', 'Technically correct, and only upon finding ?misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest"" or ""other good cause.? Rosenstein has said,as recently as Dec. 13, that he sees no such reason to dismiss Mueller. Short of firing the special counsel, Rosenstein could reel in the investigation by finding one of more of its strategies or techniques ""so inappropriate or unwarranted under established departmental practices that it should not be pursued."" But Rosenstein has given no indication that he?s contemplating this step, either.', 'Yes, since a president?s power over the executive branch is vast.\xa0Last June, Trump wanted to fire Mueller, according to three people familiar with the matter. The New York Times reported that White House counsel Donald McGahn refused to pass that order to the Justice Department and threatened to resign. Another option -- which Trump also considered, according to the Times -- would be to fire Rosenstein and pressure his successor to dismiss Mueller, repeating the steps as needed until finding someone willing to carry out his wishes. (A firing and a pair of resignations touched off by President Richard Nixon during the late stages of the Watergate investigation went down in history as the ""Saturday Night Massacre."") Or Trump could fire Sessions, with the expectation that Sessions? successor would seize control of the case from Rosenstein -- and fire Mueller. Under yet another scenario,offeredby the author of the special-counsel regulations, Trump could order their repeal, then fire Mueller by himself.', 'Not necessarily. The investigation predated Mueller?s appointment as special counsel and already has some prosecutions underway. If Mueller were to be dismissed, much would depend on his successor -- who would, presumably, be appointed by Rosenstein.', 'Yes, but without much legislative progress. Senators Thom Tillis, a Republican, and Chris Coons, a Democrat, proposed a bill establishing that a fired special counsel would be reinstated if a panel of judges finds no good cause for the removal. Two other senators,\xa0Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Cory Booker, offered a bill that would require the attorney general or acting attorney general to get approval from a three-judge panel before firing a special counsel. Both bills have raised constitutional questions, and both facean uphill battlejust to get to the Senate floor for a vote.', 'Hecould sueto challenge the grounds for his dismissal. Beyond that, much of the fallout would depend on Trump?s fellow Republicans in Congress, who hold majorities in the House and the Senate. Democrats could be expected to express their outrage by offering proposals to reinstate Mueller and to remove Trump as president, on grounds that he had obstructed justice. But Democrats couldn?t accomplish that on their own, and at the moment, many Republicans are farmore criticalof Mueller than protective.', 'Since removing a president isa political process, not a legal one, anything can be grounds for impeachment if enough members of Congress say it is. The Constitution says the president (and vice president and judges and members of the cabinet) ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Nanda said.', 'In 2015, RBI had granted ?in-principle? approval to 11 entities, including the Department of Posts, to set up payments banks. Payments banks can accept deposits of up to Rs1 lakh per account from individuals and small businesses. Unlike traditional banks, payments banks are not allowed to give loans or credit to customers.', 'The new model of banking allows mobile firms, super market chains and others to cater to banking requirements of individuals and small businesses. A payments bank is a differentiated bank and confines its activities to acceptance of demand deposits, remittance services, Internet banking and other specified services.', 'IPPB will be the third payments bank to have full fledged operations after Airtel Payments Bank and Paytm.', '?We will offer door step banking service which none of the payments banks are in position to provide. Also, the cost of transaction will be very competitive,? Nanda said. IPPB launched its pilot services in Raipur and Ranchi in January 2017 and expected to expand to 650 branches across the country by September 2017.', 'However, its plans were delayed, as it could not sign up the system integrator (SI) within the schedule timeline. Nanda said IPPB will have an edge over competition in the market due to vast reach of post offices and the trust factor that it commands. ?We expect to break even in the third year of operation. There are already around 17 crore post office savings bank accounts which will get some services from IPPB. Even if we are able to open 50 accounts from each access point of 1.55 lakh, the number will be huge in the first year of operations,? he said.', 'IPPB will have a workforce of about 3,500. It has already started recruitment drive for 1,700. ?Most of the employees will be from open market and from among those who are on deputation in government departments, including India Post,? he said.']"

Finance minister Arun Jaitley termed the scheme Modicare, on the lines of  Obamacare, the universal health insurance plan introduced in the US during Barack Obama?s presidency.', 'Few, however, know that Dr Vinod Kumar Paul, member (health and nutrition) at the country?s apex policy think tank NITI Aayog, led the team that designed the world?s largest government funded financial protection scheme for healthcare that will cover as many as 500 million Indians. In an interview, Dr Paul comments on how the idea for this ambitious programme came about and how the project is going to be implemented in a country that has a dismal record of healthcare delivery. Edited excerpts:', 'What was the ideology behind planning the NHPS? What factors were taken into consideration while charting out this programme?', 'There are basically two pillars of Ayushman Bharat programme under which we are bringing reforms in the healthcare system. One is strengthening our primary healthcare foundation; second is financial health protection for the citizens. The two components of Ayushman Bharat are interlinked. Till now the existing sub-centres are catering to only maternal and child healthcare services but the 1.5 lakh sub-centres that we are converting into wellness centres will cater to majority of services such as detection and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, chronic bronchitis, screening for common cancers, mental health, care of the elderly, eye care, etc. We have added all these things into primary healthcare. Financial health protection is the foundation of any nation?s healthcare policy. Through the National Health Protection Scheme, we will reduce impoverishment due to out of pocket health spending and want to take healthcare in India to the next level by covering the poor and vulnerable 40% of the Indian population by this aspirational model. It is a decisive step toward the goal of universal health coverage.', 'Health insurance schemes in India have seen little success, barring a few states in the south, how do you think this programme is going to fair?', 'First of all, this is not just a health insurance scheme but this is a health assurance scheme for Indians. As health is a state subject, this will be implemented by states and with their own choice. The states will be a custodian of this scheme. Some states can choose an intermediary to implement it such as an insurance company while some may try a trust model in which there will be an autonomous body under the government that will bear all the expenditure. This is a tax-funded scheme.', 'What are the details and timeline of the programme?', 'This scheme is about covering expenses of hospitalization for secondary and tertiary care. In India, out-of-pocket expenditure is over 60% which is one of the highest in the world. Around 6-7 crore people fall into poverty each year due to medical expenses and they are often the non-poor. This one nation, one scheme, will give coverage of Rs5 lakh to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families which means about 50 crore people in India. This will be a cashless, Aadhaar-enabled scheme with 60:40 centre and state share. As far as tentative timeline of the scheme is concerned, the scheme will be finalized after further consultations with state governments, preparation for fraud-proof information system, states? preparation for beneficiary identification, after finalization of guidelines for hospital empanelment and strategic purchase. As soon as the states are ready, the scheme will be rolled out.', 'As projected, the implementation of the programme will require Rs12,000 crore for the first phase for 10 crore families. Do you think the India as one of the economies spending least on healthcare i.e. below 2% of GDP, will able to handle the huge costs involved?', 'As government has given the policy direction, it will fulfil its promise of provisioning adequate funds. I agree that the expenditure on healthcare in India is too less but we have made provisions for a cess that will generate additional\xa0Rs11,000 crore. As envisaged in the National Health Policy, the government will incrementally increase the health expenditure to 2.5% of GDP by 2025. Ayushman Bharat represents the resolve of government to transform the health system in order to ensure that people of India experience good health, live longer, have health lifestyles, and can access quality care without financial hardship if they fall sick. If  finance minister Arun Jaitley has promised to provide adequate funds for Ayushman Bharat, we should believe him. State governments will also increase their health budgets when they join the national scheme.', 'As under the programme, poor and vulnerable people will be entitled to treatment in empaneled central, state government hospitals and selected private hospitals, on what parameters will the private hospitals be selected for empanelment?', 'The hospitals will be chosen on the basis of a structured criteria including optimum facilities, assurance of patient services, accountability and infrastructure for treatment of diseases. We have prepared the framework for this criteria and selection. Selected state and central government hospitals and selected empanelled private hospitals will come in the scheme?s ambit and will serve the beneficiaries. Thus the scheme will be delivered by a network of public and private hospitals. Private hospitals are also nation?s asset.', 'What are the diseases covered this time which have never been covered in any national or state health insurance scheme?', 'The government has already prepared around 1,100 packages for the scheme. There will be certainly several new diseases covered under the new scheme which were earlier not covered under any government health insurance scheme such as dental services, geriatric services and HIV/AIDS etc. We have largely covered almost everything. We hope to cover most of the conditions requiring tertiary and secondary care.', 'As expected almost 40% of Indian population will be covered for free and cashless healthcare with focus on rural India. How will the country that already has a shortage of doctors handle so many patients?', 'For tackling the shortage of doctors, the government has already announced opening of 24 new medical colleges. The workforce will be prepared to serve various hospitals. As the concentration of specialist doctors is more in urban areas, we have plans to give more incentives to doctors who serve in rural areas. We also have various training programmes for nurses and paramedical staff who have long experiences working with senior doctors in tackling common diseases conditions and know the righteous medicines and treatment modalities. Such utilisation of resources will be done until the number of doctors can be increased.', 'Private hospitals have been complaining about delays in payments for treatment provided to patients under government run health insurance scheme ? Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). How will government ensure to avoid such delays and tussles in the new scheme?', 'We will ensure that such delays and discrepancies don?t happen in NHPS. We will have a proper agency for this purpose to look after smooth flow of money and all the premiums are paid on time.']"

An examination of the fine print suggests that while there may be some upside risks to inflation, fiscal deficit targets look likely to be met.', 'First, the full cost of the health protection scheme that promises Rs5 lakh per household per year appears to be more than what has been budgeted. Second, oil prices may rise while budget estimates seem to assume a scenario of benign oil prices and this may have fiscal implications. Third, the government has announced a 50% increase in minimum support prices (MSP) for the coming kharif crop that could lead to a higher deficit. In addition, the corporate tax rate for small enterprises has been cut to 25%.', 'On the first count, rolling out an all-India health insurance scheme is a challenging task. State capacity to deliver is limited. From the private sector side, good quality tertiary healthcare is still not available all across the country as would be required for this scheme. The supply response of the private sector to the incentives created by this scheme may take some time to realize.', 'In addition, regulatory capacity of, one, the health sector to regulate the private providers, and, two, the health insurance sector to make sure fraud does not become rampant will take time to develop.', 'Further, states need to come on board as well for this scheme. Many of them already have their own insurance schemes and will need to replace old schemes. The transition from old to new schemes may require time. This may mean that the new scheme will have limited expenditure in the current year. The allocation of only Rs2,000 crore suggests that this may indeed be the expectation of the government as well. This may mean that the impact on the deficit of the health insurance scheme may be limited.', 'Oil prices have been rising in recent days. This could put an upward pressure on fuel prices. When global oil prices were falling, the decline in price was not passed on to the consumer as the government increased excise duties. It remains to be seen whether the government will try to keep the price of oil stable. If oil prices rise, would excise be cut to cushion the consumer from the price rise? If so, how would this impact excise collections?', 'Further, the impact of the oil price hike on fertilizer subsidy will be another issue to contend with. The oil price hike would also mean a larger import bill and a higher current account deficit. This could possibly put downward pressure on the rupee.', 'In the past, it has been seen that increase in MSP has led to food inflation. Another channel through which the impact of the MSP hike could be inflationary is through a larger fiscal deficit. There are two possible models through which higher MSP is paid to farmers. One is via actual procurement of foodgrains by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from farmers, which pays MSP to farmers.', 'However, given that the capacity of FCI to procure all the foodgrains listed across the country is limited, the alternative is to directly pay farmers the difference between market price and MSP. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the scheme benefits traders. In places where this scheme has been tried, it has been found that the difference goes to a large extent into the hands of traders who pay farmers low prices and collude with them to pass on the additional payment to them.', 'This could mean a big payout by the government but not an equal increase in the income of farmers. If ?leakage? arising from this flaw in the scheme could be limited, the deficit could remain under control.', 'In the budget speech of March 2015, the finance minister had promised to bring down the corporate tax rate to 25% over a period of four years. This promise was made on the grounds that the regime of corporate taxes in India needed to be rationalized, exemptions to be removed, and tax rates to be brought down to globally competitive levels. By the end of four years, the corporate tax rate has been cut only for smaller enterprises, which account for roughly less than 10% of corporate tax payments. The remaining corporates will still pay higher taxes.', 'One reason for not going ahead with the reform has been the difficulties in removing exemptions. If the finance minister had gone ahead with reducing the corporate tax rate for all enterprises without removing exemptions, collections would have suffered. While it is a pity that the reform has not been attempted, the effect of the rate cut on the deficit would be limited since only a small share of tax collections will be affected.', 'One clear impact of the budget will be higher personal income tax collections on account of the long-term capital gains tax, dividend distribution tax for mutual funds and the increase in education cess. As the GST (goods and services tax) regime is simplified, we may also see a pickup in GST collections.', 'What does all this mean for inflationary expectations and monetary policy?', 'Over the past one year, the monetary policy committee (MPC) has repeatedly raised concerns about the fiscal deficit. Whenever rates have not been cut despite inflation being around or even below the target of 4%, the MPC has pointed to fiscal slippages and possible higher borrowing due to the Seventh Pay Commission, and higher house rent allowance. Though the MPC may have concerns about the fiscal deficit, if the limited capacity of the government?s delivery mechanisms is taken into account, the MPC should not be overly concerned. This can create space for an accommodative stance of monetary policy.', 'Published with permission fromIdeas For India, an economics and policy portal.', 'Ila Patnaik is a professor at NIPFP.']"

Individuals accounted for the highest proportion of long-term gains declared in two out of the four years for which income tax numbers are available. Companies come out on top for the other two years.', 'Companies accounted for 49.19% of long-term capital gains in the latest year available which is financial year 2014-15 (corresponding to assessment year 2015-16).

Less than 1% of the tax returns filed mention long-term capital gains across the years.', 'The caveat to this is that the data includes all kinds of long-term capital gains: transactions on property, bullion and others. The government has not released more granular data. It would be interesting to see if the trend is significantly different if one considers long-term capital gains on only listed securities.

In fact, it has been observed that India has an especially liberal taxation policy on capital gains after long-term gains were made tax-free in the 2004 budget.', '?The paper finds that capital gains tax on securities is very liberal in India... Distinction between capital gains on the basis of holding period and exemption of long-term capital gains, coupled with a low flat tax rate of 15% on short-term capital gains, is resulting in severe revenue implications for the exchequer in India,? said a May 2016 paper entitledRevisiting Capital Gains Tax on Securities in India,authored by Prashant Prakash, Jaya Kumari Pandey and Abhishek K.

There are peaks seen during the bull run preceding the global financial crisis. Similar gains are seen when the markets rose after the Narendra Modi government came to power. This may also mean that a crash in markets would erode collections.', 'The caveat to this is that the methodology considers that investors held half the delivered shares for more than a year. It also assumes that the capital gains realized on the same were not more than 50% of the final selling price. Differences in the proportion of delivered shares which have been held for more than a year, and the degree of their gains may alter the arithmetic. However, it does give an estimate which is useful until more granular data is made available.', 'The gains through the new tax would be important at a time the Modi government has been struggling with meeting fiscal targets. The fiscal deficit has been targeted at 3.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 2018-19. This is higher than the earlier target of 3%. The new tax would help reduce the deficit by 0.1% of GDP, based on the government?s expected collection of Rs20,000 crore.', 'A little extra tax from the average stock market investor may not be asking for too much at such a time, though the government could consider providing indexation benefits and removal of securities transaction tax to soften the blow.']"

The budget speech showed the state?s revenues are flat or falling, while spending is up.', 'Finance minister Thomas Isaac blamed the goods and services tax (GST) for most of the revenue shortfall.', '?The common assumption that tax revenue will increase with the rollout of GST has not become a reality. The reason is simple: the administrative system for GST is not yet functional,? he said in his budget speech.', '?I expected Kerala?s revenues to increase by 20-25% after GST, but it is still growing below 10%. The Rs1.35 lakh crore IGST (integrated goods and services tax, one of the three categories of tax under GST) collected so far has not been distributed to the states. The IGST is also leaking. Seventy-five percent of goods used in Kerala comes from outside the state. This should mean the IGST should be at least the double of the SGST (state goods and services tax), but that has not happened,? he said.', 'However, he admits the shrinkage of state?s own revenue has contributed to the problem. ?Revenue from the tax on petroleum products and registration stamps (the two main taxes which are still under the state?s control) are also growing at a slower pace than expected (at 18% and 11.3%, respectively). Kerala?s tax revenue income increased only at 5.2%, contrary to the estimated 16.08% increase in the previous budget. The total revenue income increased 7.7% only, while the plan fund expenditure increased 22% and unplanned expenditure increased 21%,? he said.', 'The mismatch between the revenue and expenditure, Isaac says, has made it hard for the government to find money for new projects. In turn, the budget calls for severe fiscal discipline. Including this budget, each budget ahead will try to narrow revenue deficit by 20-30 basis points and keep it below the 3% limit allowed for states, Isaac said. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.', 'However, the government has not sacrificed expenditure on social welfare. The government will continue with its plan to spend Rs 4,000 crore to build social and physical infrastructure under a recently floated government company called Kerala Institutional Investment Fund Board or KIIFB.', '?If we have to look for capital expenditure under the usual budgetary schemes, we will have to wait for at least two decades to find the money. That will mean a generation will lose out on opportunities. Instead, we will do it today under KIIFB,? Isaac said.', 'The budget has given a grant of Rs4,270 crore for KIIFB to foot its bills for the next four months. For the rest of the year and projects, it is expected to raise the money from the market in the form of chit funds, bonds and guarantees?all of which will be outside budget borrowings, planned to be repaid using the state?s own tax revenue and other means.', 'The budget has also kept funding intact for most ongoing welfare schemes, including a plan to build houses for the homeless, urban and rural food security measures, projects to give public schools a facelift, and healthcare and pension schemes.', 'Isaac announced Rs2,500 crore for the affordable housing project, Rs954 crore for food subsidy measures, about Rs1,000 crore for reviving public schools and Rs6,000 crore for distributing welfare pensions. There are even certain fresh expenditures, like an allocation of Rs2,000 crore for coastal area development in the wake of destruction caused by cyclone Ockhi and a Rs3,400 crore loan to revive the state road transport company.', 'A new health insurance scheme announced in the Union budget on Thursday to provide Rs2 lakh cover each to one million families would have saved Kerala some money, as it is already giving over five million families health insurance of about Rs10 lakh using both central and state funds. Instead, Isaac?s budget states it will foot the premium of those who may be left out once the new scheme is implemented, and ensure the beneficiary list is unchanged.', 'The budget has discouraged departments from buying cars priced above Rs14 lakh and promoting the use of rental cars and cab aggregators. The finance minister also wants public officials to use video conferencing more so as to reduce travel expenses. Foreign trips will be allowed only if they are absolutely necessary, he said. Government offices are also asked to consider switching away from high-cost landline telephones to low-cost mobile connections to cut phone bills.

Banerjee told a public rally in Darjeeling on Wednesday, adding that her key concern is development and peace.', 'On Tuesday, Banerjee had said at another function that she would not claim ?any share? in the gains from peace and development in Darjeeling.', '?Peace and development come first, electoral politics secondary,? Goutam Deb, a cabinet minister and a key Trinamool Congress leader in north Bengal, said in a phone interview, echoing her view.', 'In June last year, the Gorkha community launched a stir soon after elections to the local municipal bodies showed the Trinamool Congress was fast gaining ground in the hills. Because of a rift within the dominant Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), the Trinamool Congress even managed to secure the municipal board in the hill town of Mirik.', 'Banerjee had described the results as the beginning of a ?new era?, while another Trinamool Congress leader and cabinet minister Arup Biswas had said people in the hills had finally voted for development.', 'To gain ground, Banerjee had created several development boards in Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts in a move widely seen by the Gorkhas as divisive politics. In early June, after the chief minister visited the hills for a cabinet meeting, the Gorkhas launched a violent agitation, shutting down Darjeeling for at least 104 days.', 'The Gorkha community has always reacted sharply to parties from the plains making inroads into Darjeeling. Back in the early 1980s, when Left parties tried to penetrate tea garden trade unions, the Gorkhas fought back. In the violent standoff in the mid-1980s, at least 1,200 people perished. Eventually, the Left backed down, allowing Gorkhas some autonomy in administration.', '?The Trinamool Congress?s attempt to enter the hills and the resistance it faced from the Gorkhas was a rerun of what happened in the 1980s,? said a political analyst, who asked not to be identified. It appears that the chief minister has realised that it is better from the standpoint of administration not to expand politically in the hills, he added.', 'On Wednesday, Banerjee appealed to the Gorkha community to desist from disruptive politics, saying it only benefits neighbouring Sikkim, which was alleged to have harboured the fugitive GJM leader Bimal Gurung. She also promised to push industrialization in Darjeeling if the Gorkhas helped create a conducive atmosphere.']"

The Chabahar port offers an alternative route for India to access landlocked Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics, given India?s tense ties with Pakistan.', 'According to a report in the IsraeliHaaretznewspaper late Wednesday, this is the first time in seven decades that Riyadh is allowing flights to Israel to use Saudi airspace. Saudi Arabia officially does not recognize the existence of Israel. Saudi airspace has been closed not only to Israeli aircraft, but to those of other nations with a flight path to Israel. Most flights to Israel have to make a customary stop in Amman before continuing to Israel.', 'Hopes that Saudi Arabia may allow Air India to use its airspace to fly to Tel Aviv floated after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to India last month expressed the hope that the direct flight between India and Israel would fructify soon.', '?The way I think Israel and the Sunni Arab states can progress is by taking small steady steps toward more normalized interactions, not normalization, but normalized interactions,? Dore Gold, a former foreign ministry director-general who in the past has had informal contact with the Saudis, was quoted as saying by theJerusalem Postwebsite. ?There is a steady improvement of contacts between Israel and Sunni Arab states, and this is just another case of that. It?s not El Al, but it?s not bad,? Gold was quoted as saying.', 'Israel?s national carrier El Al operates three flights to Mumbai a week but it avoids the Arabian peninsula while flying east towards India?making it an eight-hour lengthy journey. During the eight-hour route from Ben-Gurion International Airport to Mumbai, the flight crosses the Red Sea south of Yemen, then turns east to India.', 'The flight time using Saudi airspace is expected to cut two hours of flying time, people familiar with the developments said, though the Indian foreign ministry did not confirm theHaaretznews report. The decision, which will be implemented in March this year, will also reduce the fuel costs which means cheaper tickets for passengers. The flight to New Delhi will now take only six hours. This route, however, is still not the shortest, since the most direct route would be to fly across Iraq, Iran and Pakistan, a person familiar with the development in New Delhi said.', 'The opening up of Saudi airspace for flights to Israel is being seen as a direct result of increasing interaction between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It was the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that was seen as the major factor for pulling Israel and its Gulf Arab neighbours together. Sunni majority Saudi Arabia that wields considerable influence in the Gulf region perceives Shia-dominated Iran as an ideological threat and a competitor for influence in the region. And Israel sees Iran as an existential threat. And any deal that was seen as freeing Iran from international sanctions has been opposed by both the Gulf states and Israel.', 'The Saudi move can ?also be seen as influence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the region,? said theHaaretzreport. Modi is scheduled to visit Palestinian territories on 10 February. Last year, he became the first Indian prime minister to go to Israel on an official state visit.']"

The disappearance of Flight 370 remains the biggest mystery in modern aviation, and the search to find it is the world?s longest hunt for any jet. Last month, a new crew resumed scouring the Indian Ocean.', 'In an era where people can track their iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices in real time, the world?s most-advanced transportation industry still isn?t obligated to do the same for craft carrying about 4 billion passengers a year.

That?s equivalent to the size of Florida.', 'There would be little chance of finding survivors in time, especially in the open ocean, and the sunken wreckage might escape detection for years, said Geoffrey Dell, a safety scientist at Central Queensland University in Australia who?s been an air-safety investigator since 1979.', 'By comparison, the search zone for a plane that crashed between one-minute pings would be about 748 square kilometres?an area 227 times smaller.', '?The industry takes strategic steps to ensure safety but moves very deliberately,?

Its Automated Flight Information Reporting System is about the size of a briefcase, costs less than $60,000 and can pinpoint a plane?s airborne location every 20 seconds.', 'About 1,800 aircraft have installed the product, Schmutz said.', 'The slow rollout of more-frequent tracking comes during a period of sustained growth for the global aviation industry, especially in Asia.', 'MH370 disappeared 8 March 2014, while flying to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. Experts mapped the Boeing 777?s random route over the Indian Ocean after picking through its hourly data hookups with a satellite.', 'Only a few pieces of wreckage washed up in Africa, and no bodies were recovered. US exploration company Ocean Infinity resumed searching last month with a promise of as much as $70 million from the Malaysian government if successful.', 'ICAO said it ?moved quite rapidly? to develop new tracking intervals after the MH370 crash, and those rules contain an incentive for airlines to retrofit in-service craft to enable one-minute reporting.', 'Under the rules taking effect in 2021, a plane would switch to one-minute tracking automatically when systems detected it was in distress because of turbulence, mechanical difficulties or an unexplained change in course, such as during a hijacking or if the crew became unconscious.', 'Pilots couldn?t turn the system off after it activates automatically, ICAO said. The system would deactivate itself once the plane was flying safely again.', 'However, a pilot could turn off the system if it was manually activated.', 'The challenges tied to minute-by-minute tracking include adding computing power and internet bandwidth to process larger volumes of data. The tighter system also may require reserving more space on the flurry of satellites being launched to satisfy demands for constant internet connectivity.', 'The almost seven-year lag that will exist between the disappearance of MH370 and the institution of one-minute tracking shows the struggle going on within the industry.', 'Airlines haven?t immediately rolled out tamper-proof tracking technology on every commercial aircraft?potentially at a cost of more than $1 billion?partly because an event like MH370 is so rare.', '?It always comes back to a commercial decision,? said Dell, a former safety manager at Qantas. ?Does it really justify it when that accident is not going to happen in your lifetime?statistically?

Through hashtags, short videos, tweets, blog posts and the creative use of social media, the campaign called ?#Digital Hifazat? is seeking to raise awareness about the recent but rampant, phenomenon of online harassment and the problem with existing legislation.', 'The #Digital Hifazat campaign was the winner of the SM4E awards in the ?Online Safety? category, organized by the Digital Empowerment Foundation in 2017.', 'It was initiated by a digital magazine, Feminism in India (FII), which focuses on the feminist perspective on issues ranging from sexuality, violence and body image to health, sports and science. This gender-oriented platform was started in 2013 by 28-year-old Delhi-based researcher and writer Japleen Pasricha.', 'The movement has sought to raise awareness about cyber harassment by crowd-sourcing articles and online content from followers and writers on experiences of online abuse, provide legal analysis of cybercrime prevention laws in India, and suggests steps towards making the Internet safe, secure and accessible. FII publishes articles on image-based sexual abuse (revenge porn), online abuse, laws that help victims of cybercrimes and cyber violence against women on social media and online dating apps, the need for women to reclaim the Internet, and feminist principles of the Internet.', '?We published deeply-researched articles each day of our month-long campaign, which were shared widely on social media and received a lot of engagement from our audience,? says Pasricha.', 'The idea for the #Digital Hifazat,? Pasricha says, came after she was commissioned to write a report on cyber violence against women in India by US-based NGO Freedom House. After the report was published, she used the findings to design the campaign in late 2016.', '?Online VAW is still a new form of violence globally and especially in India, and not many women?s rights NGOs in India work on it. Being a digital-only platform and an organization that faces online harassment almost daily, it became important for us to take up this issue and work extensively on it,? she notes.', 'Cyber harassment includes stalking, offending a person online with unwanted sexually explicit messages, and threats of violence or hate speech. The most disturbing form of online violence is non-consensual pornography.', 'Research shows that an estimated one in 10 women globally have already experienced some form of cyber violence since the age of 15.', 'According to a 2015 UN report,?Cyber Violence against Women and Girls: a Worldwide Wake-Up Call?, online violence is just as lethal to women as physical violence, and has warned that women are growing even more vulnerable to cyber violence as internet access spreads to more areas. It estimates that 73% of women have endured cyber violence, and that women are 27 times more likely than men to be harassed online.', 'Pasricha?s report also found that women in India have trouble thinking about the attacks they experience on social media platforms as ?violent?, and are likely to ignore or block their assailants. Many lacked awareness of their legal rights as victims of cyber stalking and other crimes.', 'FII has been actively using all the three major social media channels?Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?to reach a wider audience for its campaign. Pasricha underlines that social media is an intrinsic part of the organization, as it is the main way in which it disseminates daily content.', '?Our expertise in social media has also led us to conduct training and workshops on social media management for NGOs, NPOs and social enterprises,? she says.', 'The digital magazine draws maximum engagement from Facebook, where FII has over 41,000 likes.', 'On its page, FII shares a variety of multimedia content including posts, images, and short and engaging videos.

I wanted to make feminist content, which the young people will read and consume using pop culture and social media. I also wanted it to be free and accessible knowledge in terms of language,? she says.', 'Despite the impact, Pasricha highlights, FII has had difficulty in finding partners willing to pay for digital media services irrespective of the massive outreach it promises.', 'Also, recognizing that most of its writers belong to a privileged section of the society, FII is actively seeking out voices from marginalized communities and aims to diversify its writers? pool.', '?We also plan to engage college youth this year with workshops and (a) campus ambassador program,? she marks.', 'Minthas a strategic partnership with Digital Empowerment Foundation, which hosts the Manthan and mBillionth awards.']"

There has been historical backwardness. There have been lack of policies in the past. You have been in power for 55 years. Just introspect as to how much you contributed in either removing these problems or creating these problems.?', 'The opposition targeted the government in the Rajya Sabha over issues of agrarian distress and unemployment.

Questioning one of the key highlights of the budget, which the government has projected as a pro-farmer measure, Ramesh stated that while it has been said that the MSP would be set at 50% above the cost, it had not been made clear what would be the criterion for deciding the cost of production.', 'The cost varied according to the method chosen, he said referring to a newspaper interview by a Niti Aayog functionary, he said it appeared that the promise made by the finance minister Arun Jaitley was the government?s ?jumla number one?.', 'He also claimed that insufficient funds were allocated for the health insurance scheme.
