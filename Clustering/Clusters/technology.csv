Chief among them: Apple Inc.', 'If Broadcom succeeds in buying Qualcomm, itself seeking to close a deal for chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV, the transactions would bring a quarter of the chip suppliers used in the iPhone X\xa0under one roof. That kind of market concentration should be anathema to a customer like Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, a master manager of his company?s long, diverse, global chain of parts providers.', '?Does he really want one guy to have that much power over the supply chain?? said Mike Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity.', 'Yet Apple isn?t grousing publicly and Hock Tan, Broadcom?s CEO, has suggested that Apple is comfortable with the deal. ?We would not undertake this if we are not highly confident our common key customers would embrace it,? he said late last year. That?s a contrast to some Android phone makers that havecomplained openlyabout the proposal. Apple declined to comment.', 'Apple isn?t complaining because a Broadcom acquisition of Qualcomm would probably save the iPhone maker billions of dollars in licensing fees while posing risks for Apple?s key smartphone competitors.', 'In what would be a clear boon to Apple, Broadcom plans to close Qualcomm?s licensing business over time because it causes too much friction with customers, according to people familiar with its plans.', 'For years, Qualcomm was the sole provider of modem chips for iPhones and iPads, but nowadays Apple is designing more of its own components, making the companies more like rivals than supply chain partners.', 'Qualcomm also charges Apple and other phone makers\xa0license fees from patents covering the fundamentals of all modern handsets. The levy, a percentage of the price of each device sold, has been Qualcomm?s main source of profit and costs Apple about $2 billion a year, analysts estimate.', 'Apple stopped paying last year and accused Qualcomm of illegally using its dominance in cell phone chips to demand inflated licensing fees. Once in control, Broadcom could save Apple money by ending those fees.', '?They think it?s done. They want to get rid of licensing,? said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C.

If I?m Apple, I?m going to probably pay less.?', 'Broadcom ownership of Qualcomm may also hobble competing smartphone makers, according to Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Qualcomm?s licensing profits have funded deep research and development that?s improved mobile internet connections and turned phones into pocket-sized computers. Those benefits go to all industry players, not just Apple, though.', 'Apple can charge $1,000 for a phone because consumers believe the iPhone is the best performing device. In China, that premium position has been\xa0eroded by Android-based local phone makers like Oppo and Vivo, that rely heavily on Qualcomm chips. The competition from Qualcomm-dependent rivals lessens the value of Apple?s component designs and creates more tension with Qualcomm.', 'Qualcomm is ?lowering the innovation that vendors in the Android ecosystem have to put in, so they?re making it easier to compete with Apple,"" Milanesi said. ?Qualcomm invests a lot in innovation and driving things forward, which creates more of a competition for what Apple is doing in chips.?', 'Broadcom executives plan to reduce spending on R&D to 15 percent of revenue from about 19 percent. An independent Qualcomm wants to splurge almost a quarter of sales on R&D. That equals about $5.5 billion a year invested by Qualcomm, compared with about $3.2 billion at Broadcom.', 'While Broadcom spends less than Qualcomm, the budget is heavily focused on improving its Wi-Fi chips and other components where it currently dominates, according to Broadcom Chief Technical Officer Henry Samueli.', 'That?s less threatening than Qualcomm?s R&D efforts, which often take it into new territory where Apple is investing heavily, too. Earlier this month, the chipmaker unveiled a wireless headphone chip that it said works better than the Apple-designed processor in AirPods.', 'Rather than spending money and time inventing technology that could compete with Apple in a decade, Broadcom aims to support Apple?s and other phone makers? near-term goal of releasing the most-advanced smartphone every year.', '?We?re not looking at starting totally new projects where maybe five to ten years from now they may generate revenue, they may generate profitability,?\xa0said Samueli. ?We?re going after real projects that are in the pipeline with customers lined up and ready to go.?', '', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Alibaba subsequently went its own way, setting up its own local services unit Koubei with affiliate Ant Financial.', '?Meituan and Didi definitely have the ambition,? said Zhou Xin, an internet consultant with Beijing-based Trustdata. ?Alibaba and Tencent have been paying close attention to these smaller companies, because even if Meituan and Didi don?t have the clout to overthrow them anytime soon, the smaller two could affect the power dynamics significantly.?', 'Of the two, Beijing-based Meituan\xa0seems more adventurous. Meituan said this month it?s planning to offer taxi and car-hailing services in seven cities including Beijing and Shanghai.', 'It remains to be seen how Tencent will handle the conflict. Chen brushes aside speculation Meituan?s trying to undermine WeChat,\xa0which also offers similar services.', '?Meituan has now expanded into every vertical in the service sector,? said Steven Zhu, a Shanghai-based analyst with Pacific Epoch. ?The key logic behind all these moves is that it wants to capture as much traffic as possible.?', 'Payments are an area of focus for Tencent because of its potential to illuminate purchasing behavior. Billionaire Jack Ma?s Alipay still accounts for the majority of online payments -- roughly 54 percent as of the end of September. But that?s a far cry from 80 percent just four years ago. Tencent now accounts for about 40 percent, according to research firm Analysys International.', 'Now Meituan has begun promoting the use of its own digital wallet on its app: it handles about a fifth of transactions from its 300 million-plus users. Tencent accounts for about 60 percent, whereas Alipay and others contribute about 20 percent, Chen said. And it?s now offering to connect third-party merchants and service providers to its own back end.', '?The reason we are promoting our own payments is because this will make the experience better for people who frequently use our platform,?

Shares of Altria Group Inc., which has a U.S. licensing agreement for iQos, briefly fell 5.5 percent and ended down 2.3 percent at $69.91.', '?We are confident in our ability to address the valid questions raised by the committee with the FDA as the review process for our application continues,? said Philip Morris spokesman Corey Henry in an emailed statement.', 'Altria didn?t immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'The panel was largely unconvinced that Philip Morris presented enough data, particularly in humans as opposed to rats, to prove a reduction in exposure to harmful chemicals from iQos would shrink smokers? risk of developing diseases such as cancer that are linked to tobacco use.', '?I don?t see a whole host of studies,? Michael Weitzman, an advisory panel member and professor in the Department of Pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine, said before the vote. ?I feel very uncomfortable making the judgment call. What we?ve seen -- it suggests, it implies. I could not say under oath that what we?ve seen demonstrates.?', 'The FDA will consider the panel?s recommendations as the agency weighs whether to grant Philip Morris its request to designate iQos a ?modified risk tobacco product,? meaning it will benefit the health of the population as a whole. The designation would allow Philip Morris to market iQos as less risky than cigarettes and be the first such label granted by the FDA. The agency isn?t bound by the opinion of the advisory panel.', 'Despite the volatile stock-market reaction, some analysts weren?t surprised by the panel?s vote.', '?Our going-in assumption was that Philip Morris and Altria would face a tough audience of scientists who generally have an anti-tobacco bias,? Vivien Azer, a Cowen & Co. analyst who covers the tobacco industry, said in a note. ?The initial stock reactions seemed excessive.?', 'Azer was expecting the panel to want more research, she said.', 'IQos includes an electronic heater and a heat stick which resembles a short cigarette. Users insert the stick into the heater and draw on the stick, which has been warmed to almost 600 degrees Fahrenheit. A cigarette burns at more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the heat levels, the more harmful chemicals users are exposed to, according to Philip Morris.', 'FDA staff raised questions about iQos in a report prepared for the meeting, highlighting that a full Philip Morris study on the device?s cancer-causing potential wouldn?t come until later this year. While iQos reduced exposure to some harmful chemicals compared with smoking, users could still develop certain precancerous lesions similar to those that can be caused by traditional cigarettes, according to the staff report.', 'Altria will sell iQos in the U.S. under a licensing agreement if the FDA clears it for sale, which is a separate application from the one Philip Morris submitted to make claims that it is less risky than smoking. The FDA is expected to act on the application to sell early this year; it doesn?t have a timeline for making a decision on the relative risk of iQos.', 'Philip Morris estimates that 6 million of the 40 million smokers in the U.S. will make the switch to iQos if it is approved for sale, Antonio Ramazzotti, vice president of human insights and behavioral research at Philip Morris, said during the meeting.', '', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

The computer model?called robust label ranking (ROAR)?may help users and businesses navigate the increasingly complicated way people are expressing how they feel on social media, researchers said.', 'While Facebook once featured only one official emoticon reaction, the like button, the social media site added five more buttons?love, haha, wow, sad and angry?last year.', '?We want to understand the user?s reactions behind these clicks on the emoticons by modelling the problem as the ranking problem?given a Facebook post, can an algorithm predict the right ordering among six emoticons in terms of votes?? said Jason Zhang, a research assistant at Pennsylvania State University in the US.', '?But, what we found out was that existing solutions predict the user?s emotions and their rankings poorly in some times,? said Zhang.', 'Zhang added that merely counting clicks fails to acknowledge that some emoticons are less likely to be clicked than others, which is called the imbalance issue. For example, users tend to click the like button the most because it signals a positive interaction and it is also the default emoticon on Facebook.', '?When we post something on Facebook, our friends tend to click the positive reactions, usually love, haha, or, simply, like, but they?ll seldom click angry,? said Zhang.', 'For social media managers and advertisers, who spend billions buying Facebook advertisements each year, this imbalance may skew their analysis on how their content is actually performing on Facebook, said Dongwon Lee, associate professor at Penn State.', '?This is a step in the direction of creating a model that could tell, for instance, that a Facebook posting with a million likes in fact consists only 80 per cent likes and 20 per cent angry If such a precise understanding on social emotions is possible, that may impact how you advertise,? Lee said.', 'The new model could lead to better analytic packages for social media analysts and researchers. ?A lot of the commercial advertisements on Facebook are driven by likes,? said Lee. ?Eventually, if we can predict these emoticons more accurately using six emoticons, we can build a better model that can discern more precise distribution of emotions in the social platforms with only one emoticon?like?such as on Facebook before 2016,? he said.', 'The researchers trained the model using four Facebook post data sets including public posts from ordinary users, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, and showed that their solution significantly outperformed existing solutions.

As it turns out, the rather smooth texture that one notices while running the finger on the outer surface of each earpiece, is a result of the aluminum alloy body being sand-blasted. The cable that connects the earphones with your phone is reinforced by a material known as Kevlar, which makes it extremely robust and will not break off easily.

As a result, what you get with the E1001 Triple driver earphones is good sound, without any perceptible artificial boosting or tweaking of the audio. That is not all, because these are claimed to be the first-ever earphones to receive the THX certification?this certification means that the sound coming out of audio device is exactly as the audio engineer intended while he was recording and mixing the track. This is surely the standout feature, if ever there was any, in earphones.', 'Most of the time, what you get are detailed vocals without sounding too sharp, and fairly powerful bass and lower frequencies, without sounding hemmed in. If Trance or R&B are your preferred music genres, this will impress undoubtedly, with the vibrant bass. The sound works brilliantly for most music genres, but in some tracks (though not specific to any type of music), we did notice that the mid-range frequencies were not well distinguished. Also, the soundstage isn?t the widest, so you might miss out on some really intricate detailing in music tracks that may have multiple layers intertwined?but the fine reproduction of most elements in a music track more than makes up for that, the rest of the time.', 'The 1More E1001 Triple driver earphones is truly in a tough battle with the Sennheiser Momentum In-Ear earphones (around Rs6,990), and that is where things become a bit more complex?it isn?t easy to choose between the two. While the E1001 Triple driver surely impresses with the overall performance and a wider feature set, the Sennheiser sound is just as good in most cases and can perhaps reproduce the really finer details of a multi-layer music track, a tad better too, but falls behind comparatively on the bass levels. Too close to call, but the E1001 Triple driver is better suited for livelier music, while the Momentums are ideal for more relaxed listening.']"

If you still haven?t tried them out, here is your chance.', 'How are AR stickers different from regular stickers?', 'What separates AR stickers from regular stickers, available in a number of camera and messenger apps, is their three-dimensional design which looks more realistic. So an AR sticker when placed on a static or moving horizontal surface such as table, floor, or hand, will look like a part of the actual 3D space in front of the camera, unlike regular stickers which look more like flat 2D images. Users can capture them as photos or record them as video clips or GIFs.', 'How to use them', 'The AR stickers in Motion Stills are available under the AR mode and show right on the home screen, allowing users to get to them quickly. Users can drop them in the space in front of the camera by tapping on the sticker icon. Once the sticker shows on the screen, users can place them anywhere in the space by tapping on the screen. They can also change its orientation and size with simple pinch and zoom gestures. These stickers work offline and can be accessed anytime. The number of AR stickers available in Motion Stills is limited compared to stickers on the Pixel smartphones. It includes only 6 objects, including alien, dinosaur, hen and robot, as of now.', 'How AR mode works', 'The AR stickers in Motion Stills will work with any Android smartphone. It doesn?t require special AR sensors to track distance and position, but relies on the camera sensor, accelerometer and gyroscope, which are available on all smartphones. Accelerometer is used to detect the initial orientation of the smartphone and its position with respect to the ground plane, while gyroscope is used to track sideways rotation and twist so the app can render the virtual object in the exact position users want to put it in the space in front of the camera.']"

And that has some profound implications for artificial intelligence.,"['On a long bus ride with some friends recently, I found one was playing chess on his iPad. That is, he was playing against the little machine?or if you like, against the chess app on the little machine. I leaned over and asked: ?Who?s winning??', 'To my surprise, he said with a sheepish smile: ?I am!? Then he explained. Every now and then, he was getting the program to suggest moves for him. Or he was taking back moves that he had made and reconsidered. Or he was asking the program to take back moves that he found particularly threatening. No wonder he was winning.', 'Still, you will appreciate that mine was a rhetorical question. I?ve played occasionally against these chess programs, and it isn?t easy at all. Compared to me, they play at warp speed and nearly every move asks tough questions of my limited chess abilities. Sometimes it feels like I?m battling an onrushing tide of chess prowess, coming at me relentlessly. So when I saw my friend playing, I expected that his iPad would win the game.', 'This has been a reasonable expectation for a couple of decades now, even if you match better players than my friend against better chess programs than the iPad?s. It was in 1997 that a chess computer, Deep Blue, first beat a world chess champion?Garry Kasparov?in a match. Since then, chess computers have only improved.', 'Ever since humans invented the computer, getting one to play chess well has been a sort of holy grail of computing. Here was a game with a set of rules that was relatively simple to instruct a computer about. At the same time, the rules and the board it is played on can produce an essentially infinite number of possible games, thus offering a level of complexity challenging enough to fuel research into artificial intelligence (AI). (To put that in perspective, consider what kind of triumph it would be to produce a program that wins at noughts-and-crosses). Naturally, the earliest chess computers were pushovers for even strictly amateur players?I remember how thrilled I was to win a game against one in the late 1980s. But they got better fast. If you look at so-called Elo ratings, which tell you how strong a given player is at the game, computers have scored higher than the best humans for years?higher, in fact, than the highest Elo rating, 2,882, any human has ever achieved. (Deep Blue itself was never rated, because IBM retired it before it played enough games against players who themselves had Elo ratings).', 'So how do these programs work? In effect, by looking several moves ahead and evaluating the positions that result. That?s what humans do too. The further ahead you can look on any given move, the more you are able to compare positions and decide which is better, the more likely you are to win the game. So when I?m thinking about my next move, I?m considering what my opponent might do in response, and how I might respond to that. That?s just two moves into the future, but I am rarely able to go further. This probably explains why I?m no more than your average chess dabbler. Yet, this short-sighted view is hardly surprising, because there are usually plenty of moves available, and plenty of responses to them, and plenty of responses to those?that is, the number of possible positions rises exponentially with each possible move, and it?s humanly impossible to evaluate each one. Even the best players can only look a few moves into the future. Even then, they can prune possibilities by relying on intuition and expertise about which moves to consider and which to ignore.', '', 'But a computer? In theory, it could look at every possible move from a given position, any number of steps into the future. All it needs is the time to do that. But a chess computer that takes several hours to find the best move is, after all, hardly a chess computer. So to play chess reasonably, computers needed to get fast enough not just to apply rules, look ahead and decide on the best move in a given position, but do all that in a reasonable time. It had more going for it, but that essentially described Deep Blue, the world-beater of 1997.', 'And yet, give this some thought. If a chess computer is merely applying rules and evaluating positions, albeit at phenomenal speeds, can we really say it is intelligent? Microsoft Excel can add up the numbers in a column much faster than you or I can. Can we really say Excel is intelligent? This is why AI researchers have never quite been persuaded of the worth of getting computers to play chess in this way. No doubt Deep Blue represented a triumph of programming and exploiting the power of computers, but calling that AI is a stretch. Why are we humans intelligent, after all?', 'Get this: because we can learn how to play chess. Learning, most of us would agree, is one of those fundamentals of intelligence. So can we produce a computer that can learn chess?', 'Well, just maybe we can. In early December, chess and AI circles began buzzing with news of the feats of AlphaZero, a chess-playing program developed by Google?s AI wing, DeepMind. And of AlphaZero, you could certainly say it had learnt the game.', 'More correctly, it learnt how to play the game well. For to begin with, it was given the bare-bones rules of chess?the way knights move, the way castling happens, etc.?and no more. In that limited sense, it knew how to play chess. But it had no notion of strategies that human players use, nor of the relative values of pieces that invariably figure in human assessments of a given situation in the game. Just the rules, and then AlphaZero set to work playing itself again and again. Not just once or twice, but some 40 million times. In the process, it taught itself how to play the game, better and better all the time. This is a process AI researchers call ?reinforcement learning?.', 'The results were stunning. After just four hours of training itself this way under its belt, AlphaZero was sent into battle against a program called Stockfish. Now, Stockfish is the 2016 winner of the Top Chess Engine Championship, effectively the world championship of computer chess. Take Kasparov, Vishwanathan Anand, Bobby Fischer, Tigran Petrosian, Magnus Carlsen, any of the great champions of chess through history?Stockfish would handily beat every one of them. That?s how strong it is.', 'Stockfish and AlphaZero played 100 games. AlphaZero won 28 of those, 72 were drawn and Stockfish won precisely zero games. Stunning. Interestingly, 25 of those 28 wins came with AlphaZero playing white, which underlines what chess experts have always believed: there is an advantage that making the first move?which white does?gives you.', 'What?s more, AlphaZero played in a distinctly different style from either Stockfish or humans. As Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, remarked: ?It doesn?t play like a human, and it doesn?t play like a program. It plays in a third, almost alien, way.? It played what one article described as an ?all-out attacking style?, often apparently throwing out the window any caution a human might observe, sometimes making head-scratching but spectacular sacrifices of valuable pieces to gain an advantage in position. Strange, and yet the results spoke for themselves. If AlphaZero?s unorthodox style was going to win so overwhelmingly, perhaps there are lessons about how we have always played the game. Perhaps even lessons about how we learn. About intelligence itself.', 'It?s worth pointing out here that AlphaZero should not really be considered a chess program. It?s more like a learning machine. Given a basic set of rules, it can teach itself to play any other game too. In fact, a slightly different version of the program learnt to play Go, the Japanese board game that?s far more complicated than chess. Then it beat the program that had beaten the human Go world champion?not once or twice, but one hundred times in a row.', 'More generally, AlphaZero?s creators believe they can make their learning machine learn how to tackle tasks that have nothing to do with chess or other games. Finance, drug-testing and more ? in other words, wherever it is possible to spell out some basic rules. Whether this is really correct, we?ll have to wait and see. But meanwhile, AlphaZero has shown that computers can learn. Maybe not in the way that we humans do, but learn nevertheless.', 'And that has some profound implications for AI. Maybe for intelligence itself.', 'Once a computer scientist, Dilip D?Souza now lives in Mumbai and writes for his dinners.', 'His Twitter handle is @DeathEndsFun']"

Coupled with the bring your own device, or BYOD, trend in offices, the number of connected devices is forecast to reach over 30 billion globally by 2020, according to research firm IHS Markit Ltd. Experts opine that this connectivity boom will only increase the security risk for companies.', '?Those same devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones, routers, etc.) also access other open networks and who knows from where a ?bad actor? can inject a piece of malware into the device? Soon, the same piece of malware can be injected into the enterprise network,? cautioned Partha Narasimhan, chief technology officer of networking firm Aruba Networks Inc.?a unit of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.?in a recent interview in New Delhi.', 'Enterprise network security has evolved from just a ?perimeter solution? in the wake of the BYOD and IoT trends, Narasimhan insisted. ?Wi-Fi broke that physical perimeter paradigm, because signals tend to leak outside the building,? he explained. ?Equipment like security cameras and home routers continue to have default or factory settings that can open up the threat surface,? Narasimhan pointed out.', 'Many companies currently use mobile device management (MDM) solutions, which separate and secure business-critical data on employees? personal mobiles, to address their security needs. However, these can protect companies ?only to some extent?, according to Narasimhan, because of the complexities associated with how much control users would allow the company on their devices and whether the required security policies can be enforced.', 'According to Narasimhan, today?s security issues can be solved through the use of big data analytics and machine learning (ML)?a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies, he opined, can help chief information officers (CIOs) and chief information security officers (CISOs) reduce the number of ?false alerts? in security logs by looking at data in a context and analysing it from multiple angles. ?ML algorithms can learn a user?s behaviour over time and do not have to be taught about what is acceptable user behaviour,? he said.', 'Additionally, said Narsimhan, there are tech tools available to derive insights from data held in routers, switches and other networking equipment. ?We have been focusing a lot on leveraging the network as a sensor and analysing the data that comes out of the infrastructure,? he said, insisting that this can help CIOs and CISOs address the challenges of complexity and security resulting from the BYOD and IoT trends.', 'Analysing network data has multiple benefits, he said, including ?user experience? management. ?The user expectation is that the network is always there and whenever this expectation is not met, the network is said to be ?broken? but there can be different issues,? he said. According to him, it can be a Wi-Fi issue, a device problem or even something to do with the physical building where the user is located.', 'Identifying and fixing these issues is important to keep a company?s network in good shape and meet the future needs of users, according to Narasimhan. He said that using advanced network analytics tools, it is now possible to identify the problem and ?proactively alert? the network administrators that if they don?t do something about it for, say, another six months, they are going to ?hit a wall?.', 'Tech tools can also enable CIOs and CISOs spot anomalies for potential security threats. Also, data from the network can also give companies an indication of how well they are utilizing the physical space.', 'Industry experts concur that the growing connectivity of devices is indeed multiplying the security risks for companies. Jaspreet Singh, partner, information security at consulting firm EY, opines that in a connected scenario--in the upcoming smart cities, for instance?even a small slip-up in security can lead to chaos or catastrophic situations. ?Imagine that you are driving in your car and the navigation system is connected to the traffic signalling system which, in turn, is connected to the traffic police and other civic authorities. So, even a minor glitch in the signalling system can lead to chaos on the roads.? On their part, he said, companies need to assess the security risks across the entire network and put in customized solutions that best fit their individual needs.', 'By 2020, more than 25% of identified attacks in enterprises will involve the IoT, although the IoT will account for less than 10% of IT security budgets, according to research firm Gartner Inc. IoT, according to a Gartner e-book titledLeading the IoT(gtnr.it/2E2WlLu), ?will expand rapidly and extensively, continually surfacing novel and unforeseen opportunities and threats?, calling for a ?new type of CIO, a ?CIO of everything?, who can radically adapt their vision, decision making and capabilities to orchestrate an IoT world?.', 'Besides, the complex nature of IoT and lack of standards can also be a hindrance to effective security. Dilip Sarangan, IoT research director at Frost and Sullivan, a research firm, recently said (bit.ly/2mzCxXV), because the responsibility for IoT security is diffused across device manufacturers, network providers, software developers and many others, it is difficult for the industry to make progress on all-encompassing standards.', 'Narasimhan acknowledged the existence of these issues and said companies need to be cognizant of the growing security risks and work towards mitigating them. ?My advice would be to use a combination of solutions that gives them visibility into as well as control over their networks,? he said. On the question of accountability in IoT, he concluded, ?In a perfect world, everybody would play their part in being secure but that is not the reality.?']"
