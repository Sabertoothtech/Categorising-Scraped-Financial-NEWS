It’s a strategy he reconsidered.', '“The tax reform clearly brought a change of fundamentals,” said Kunkel, an ultra high net worth investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “We called for a 15 percent earnings growth if the tax plan passes and an 8 percent growth if it doesn’t. For me in Zurich, what was happening in Washington was a big deal.”', 'Optimism that a Trump-fueled rally will keep going is high among institutions and mom-and-pop investors alike.

Hardly a day went by without stories citing the almost eerie calm in U.S. stock markets. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, finished the year with the lowest average daily level on record. During the course of the year, we saw the market’s fear gauge set a new record low when it closed at 9.14 on Nov. 3.', 'Want more perspective? Try this: Arrange all the trading days this millennium from lowest to highest by the value of the VIX that day. The first 41 entries on that list would all be from 2017! Fully 80 of the top 100 calmest days since the turn of the century were in this past year.', 'It’s not as if there wasn’t anything to worry about. The Federal Reserve’s Partisan Conflict Index, a measure of political disagreements with data stretching back to 1981, hit its highest point on record in March. The country endured the most expensive hurricane season. Threats of a federal government shutdown came and went. Not even a nuclear showdown with North Korea could raise investors’ collective pulse. The market was simply unflappable.', 'But while we’ve all been told time and again that volatility is low and complacency is high, we’ve gotten little in the way of an explanation as to why. What’s changed? Should we expect a return to normal, or have new developments put a cap on how crazy the market can really get? Is there still value in the short VIX trade? Does this end with a bang or a whimper? We asked seven experts for their takes on why volatility has been so low.', '“I feel like we think of low volatility as a paradox because of the many random events coming out of Washington. But I’m convinced that it’s because they aren’t real events. It’s like fake news. I don’t think the market is waiting for some great event from the administration. It’s just working on its own. What we think of as important really isn’t. It’s not an accident that this notion of fake news has been embedded.”—Robert Engle, Professor of Finance at New York University and Nobel Laureate', '“No one can see any signs of an imminent recession. And of course quantitative easing contributes as well.”—Simeon Hyman, Head of Investment Strategy at Proshares Advisors LLC', '“There are good cases to be made for why realized volatility is low—and can remain there. Stability in interest rates is the bedrock around which all other stability is built.”—Dean Curnutt,\xa0Chief Executive Officer of Macro Risk Advisors LLC', '“Equity prices over long periods of time have been more volatile than their underlying fundamentals would warrant, so perhaps the explanation is that the historical levels of volatility were artificially high as much as the VIX is now artificially low.”—Eddie Perkin, Chief Equity Investment Officer at Eaton Vance Corp.', '“Passive investing is a consequence of reduced fear but also a mechanical cause for lower volatility. With the same logic, smart beta, volatility controls, shifts in annuity contracts, structured products issued abroad, to name a few—all have mechanically pushed volatility lower by substituting rules and algorithms for \xadpassionate and volatility-generating human decisions. Let’s not forget, however, that all this could work because liquidity was high and corporate earnings were very strong. Take away one or both, and everything changes.”—Daniel Benchimol, Senior Portfolio Manager at Wolverine Asset Management LLC', '“Lately, at multiyear low levels of implied volatility, short sellers of the VIX futures can expect most gains to come from the roll down of the position rather than from a further repricing lower in the absolute level of the VIX futures curve.”—Sarah Dahan, Portfolio Manager at BlueMountain Capital Management LLC', '“The biggest responsibility to the trade is to know in advance that it will go against you at some point. It’s inevitable that vol will spike and you will lose money. In my view, it is important that you are overcollateralized and that you have a long-term program in place. Tactical trading of short VIX is very difficult.”—Doug Kramer, Co-Head of Quantitative & Multi-Asset Class Investments at Neuberger Berman', '“There are a few different formats of the trade, but in general, when selling VIX futures, investors should be mindful that there could be meaningful losses and large margin calls if VIX spikes, so properly capitalizing the trades is essential.”—Sarah Dahan', '“We’ve actually already seen the effects of the crowdedness of this trade on a very small scale every time uncertainty mounted these past three years. VIX was very quick to rise by large amounts on numerous short-lived occasions. These events may not seem like much, but they were completely disproportionate compared to the rest of the equity market, giving us an idea of how a selloff could play out next time.”—Daniel Benchimol', '“We also are concerned about the success of the short volatility trade and the potential that it has become crowded. These kinds of trades tend to be unwound quickly when conditions change, potentially amplifying volatility. Given how strong corporate profits are and how committed the central banks remain to guiding the market along, this low-volatility period could last a while longer. That said, we are in the ‘Minsky moment’ camp of believing that stability, especially when prevalent for a lengthy period of time, ultimately creates instability.”—Dean Curnutt', '“Similar to the portfolio insurance dynamics in 1987, some anticipate a scenario where a volatility shock could trigger a negative feedback loop in equity markets. While it is unknown what would trigger such an event, the end result would be certain strategies forced to sell into weakness. The fear is that selling begets additional selling and the market enters a liquidity vacuum where sellers cannot find buyers of risk assets.”—Eddie Perkin', '“I think there are many inexperienced traders shorting VIX and that when vol does spike, they could panic and seek to cover their shorts. This short covering could in turn cause VIX to go up more than it otherwise would. With that said, this technical condition wouldn’t last long and volatility would eventually mean-revert to normal levels. Given how we think about the vol world, we could profit from this.”—Doug Kramer', '“One of the notable achievements in recent years is the advent of computer participation in the marketplace, from AI to algorithmic trading to the ability to generate and manage new strategies. While some of these shifts remain controversial, they all provide the addition of a new layer of order between human passionate decision-\xadmaking and the market. In fact, one could argue that volatility’s long-term mean should come down because of that. Is it to say that we won’t see volatility ever again? Of course not. We have simply entered a new era where volatile events get digested faster, at the speed of computers, but we have not eliminated chaos.”—Daniel Benchimol', '“One of the most obvious events would be an indictment of the president. I’ve asked my friends, though, and they don’t seem to think it’ll be a very volatile moment. Maybe that’s consistent with the idea that volatility, or lack thereof, comes from Washington. I think more about geopolitical events: deterioration of conditions in the Middle East or North Korea. What really scares me the most is a cyberthreat. That countries could get into our computer system. That could produce a lot of volatility and damage our system.”—Robert EngleKochkodin is a managing editor at Bloomberg News in New York.', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Before I share my final, parting words on this forum, I’d like to take a look back at how emerging markets have changed since I first began investing in the space.', 'I’ve seen some amazing transformations taking place in emerging markets first-hand through my travels—includingtransformation in travelitself! These markets continue to evolve and present new opportunities for investors and tourists alike.', 'While not recognized as a formal investment class when I first started my career, many investors certainly saw the potential in emerging-market countries. I certainly did during my work as an analyst and broker in Asia in the 1970s and early 80s.', 'The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a World Bank subsidiary, engaged in a campaign to encourage capital market developments in the less-developed countries. At that point in time, a handful of institutional investors invested $50 million in an emerging-markets strategy at the behest of the World Bank’s IFC. A year later, in 1987,MSCI developedits first emerging-markets indexes.', 'Around that time, the course of my career changed, too. I had met the legendarySir John Templetonduring my travels, and in 1987 he offered me an exciting new opportunity to manage a new emerging-markets fund. Our fund became the first of its kind to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, opening the world of emerging markets to mainstream investors. Back then, we had only a handful of markets to invest in and today there are dozens of emerging and frontier markets to consider.', 'In the early days, there were a number of challenges. Besides only having a limited number of markets open to foreign investment, there were also strict foreign exchange controls and limitations. There were problems with market liquidity, corporate governance and safekeeping of securities. And, communication and placement of orders were much more primitive—no email, internet or even mobile phones. We often relied on facsimile machines.', 'Today, we can invest in a variety of emerging markets around the world, as well as a host of lesser-developed “frontier markets,” which offer many exciting opportunities. Many of these emerging and frontier markets have been growing at a rapid pace and are quickly assimilating the latest technological advancements. For example, many companies in emerging markets have moved straight to e-commerce and e-banking models, bypassing the establishment of brick-and-mortar retail outlets. This technology “leap frogging” is important—and I think it will likely continue to open up new investment opportunities.', 'When I first started investing, emerging-market economies were generally considered commodity-driven economies, as many were dependent on commodity exports for growth. Today, we have found many highly innovative companies located in emerging markets spanning many sectors and industries. Many are highly competitive globally and are moving into technology and higher value-added production processes.', 'Today, that category only represents about 15 percent of the stocks in the index.', 'Technology-oriented companies comprised only about 3 percent of the emerging-market investment universe in the late 1990s. That didn’t change very much over the next decade, but today, around a quarter of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is in the information technology (IT) sector, which includes hardware, software, components and suppliers.', 'Additionally, we’ve seen a broadening of opportunities in the consumer sector in emerging markets amid a rising middle class with more discretionary income to spend in a wide variety of areas. The remarkable expansion of the travel industry in China is one example. Chinese travelers are not only traveling within China, but are also visiting other countries in greater numbers. China now leads the world in outbound travel,spending some $261 billionin 2016.', 'Also Read:These Five Shocks Could Thwart Two-Year Emerging-Market Rally', 'There have been many exciting developments throughout my career. In the past 30 years, I’ve seen the end of apartheid in South Africa, easier access to eastern European economies (including Russia), the opening up of India to foreign investment and, of course, China’s embrace of capitalism and rapid urbanization. I’ve also endured during many periods of upheaval and crisis, including the Latin American andAsian Financial crisesin the 1990s, theGlobal Financial Crisisof 2008–2009 and the “Arab Spring” in 2010–2011.', 'It’s also been particularly interesting to witness how the spread of smartphones and social media have facilitated and sped up change in more recent years. Corruption is still a problem around the world—and not only in emerging markets—but today it is being exposed to the world, and more politicians are being held accountable for their actions. (Brazilis a recent example.)', 'Throughout these periods of crisis and uncertainty, investors tend to panic and rush for the exits. I’ve seen it time and time again. But following the herd has more often than not proven to be a poor strategy in the long run.', 'An uncertain environment where stocks have been beaten down can offer the opportunity to pick up investment bargains, if you have the fortitude to calmly ride out the storm. In fast-growing economies in particular, markets can bounce back quickly.', 'Also Read:Wall Street Giddy on Emerging Markets Amid Overheating Signs', ""Also Read:Emerging Markets' Dream Run Could See a Reality Check in 2018"", 'Look at Argentina, for example. The country was in recession and shut out of the bond market just a few years ago, but in 2017 its benchmark equity index reached a record high as the economy staged a comeback following its 2015 presidential election. Nigeria also staged a big comeback in 2017 and was among the world’s best-performing equity markets last year after a period of economic malaise and underperformance.', 'Because, despite all the stops and false starts, booms and busts, bubbles and crashes, over the long haul, I’ve found that time heals most ills, particularly when it comes to emerging markets. Of course, we just hope leaders are wise enough to learn from history and to not repeat the mistakes of the past.', 'While I will be leaving Franklin Templeton, I’ll still be actively investing and traveling.

Active military, reserve and national guard members will only be paid for money earned before Jan. 20, according to the Pentagon.

Over his time as Chief Minister of Gujarat and the first years of his premiership, he has shown that he is not afraid to put plans into action. The World Economic Forum is surely the ideal occasion for him to set out his broader vision for India.', 'The immediate purpose of his speech is to spearhead a campaign driven by India’s Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, highlighting the huge opportunities that today’s India offers: its economy is forecast to expand by as much as 8 percent annually over the next four years and to be worth some $5 trillion by 2025, when its middle class is expected to number some 550 million. In February 2017, PwC predicted that India will be the world’s No. 2 economy by 2050.', 'Modi’s government is understandably keen to present India as an attractive destination for investors, and as a country already being transformed by the initiatives that he has driven since becoming Prime Minister in 2014. Notable among these are the Goods and Service Tax introduced in July 2017, and the adoption of a technology-driven transparent approach to doing business. The most dramatic manifestation of the latter was the decision to demonetise — and discourage a corruption-prone cash economy — with the controversial 2016 withdrawal of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.', 'The progress Modi has made has already been internationally recognised by rating agencies such as Moody’s and by authoritative indices. In 2017, India leaped 30 places (to 100th out of 190 countries) in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings, while the World Economic Forum’s own Global Competitiveness Report ranked India No. 40 of 137 countries, its highest-ever position (it stood at No. 71 three years ago).', 'Also Read:What’s On The Menu For PM Modi’s Dinner Tonight In Davos', 'That being said, Modi will be sensitive to the protectionist messages that are currently coming out of the White House, and acutely and competitively aware of the impression made by China’s President Xi at Davos a year ago, when he affirmed “China’s belief in an open and liberal global economic order”. Over the coming five years, India and China will be vying strongly for position as competitive, dynamic economies, with India tipped to take the lead when it comes to growth. For all that, China’s economy remains some five times larger than India’s, and the intricacies of India’s institutions and regulation can render policy-making frustratingly slow. But Modi professes a profound belief in the values represented by that cumbersome machinery. As he told Time in 2015: “If you were to ask me at a personal level to choose between democratic values on the one hand, and wealth, power, prosperity and fame on the other hand, I will very easily and without any doubt choose democracy and belief in democratic values.”', 'On a personal level, Modi is also the embodiment of some kind of ‘Indian Dream’ — his father ran a tea stall at a railway station and he freely admits that he experienced poverty as a child.', 'Also Read:Davos in the Donald Trump-era, Explained in 6 Charts', 'If he uses the occasion to make clear what he has accomplished over the past three-and-a-half years, he will also need to acknowledge (bearing India’s voters and a 2019 election in mind) what is yet to be achieved as his country enters a new phase as both a regional and global power.', 'Over Modi’s 13 years as Chief Minister of Gujarat, he enjoyed three successive election victories. The period brought substantial enhancements to his home state’s infrastructure, inward investment and manufacturing expanded, and the rate of state gross domestic product growth outstripped India’s as whole. While some commentators have compared him with the United Kingdom’s Margaret Thatcher, he modelled himself more closely on figures geographically closer to home: China’s Deng Xiaoping and, in particular, Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew when it came to homing in on transparency, security, education, and jobs.', 'Gujarat’s population is some 65 million, while India, with its 29 states and seven union territories, is home to 1.35 billion people and clearly represents an immense challenge.', 'Also Read:A Year Ago, Davos Thought Trump Would Be a Normal President', 'At Davos, Modi will be speaking to an audience, the ‘global elite’, which will be well disposed towards his efforts to propel India further into the 21st century by creating a transparent, market-efficient economy, while also taking a forward-looking stance on issues such as renewable energy. This ethos will remain less welcome to the constituencies back home which find ways of benefiting from long-entrenched corruption, exploitative supply chains, and tortuous bureaucracy.', 'There are some caveats, of course.', 'International investors tend to have long memories if they feel that they have suffered from reckless use of their funds. As he changes the shape and balance of industry and the employment market, he would do well to take a leaf out of Angela Merkel’s German textbook, ensuring transparency in the handling of strategic sectors that rely on scientific innovation, in the way jobs are created and skills are rethought, and in the conduct of foreign trade. All these issues are manifest in the technology sector, in which India shares prowess with the United States: a collaborative approach between these two giants should be both encouraged and nurtured. More broadly, the relationships between India and the U.S. and between India and the European Union will merit as much attention as India’s role as a regional power in Asia.', 'Since 2014, Modi has set transformation in motion, but it is too soon to pass judgement on his achievements.', 'Wherever he stands in the process, strong communication remains of the essence. The World Economic Forum is providing him with a prominent platform to excite and inspire global movers and shakers, over the coming weeks, months and years he must continue to inform and reassure the citizens of India about the significance of that vision — which is likely to disrupt the long-standing status quo — for them and their way of life.', 'Narendra Modi has a mammoth set of tasks in front of him. With his appearance at Davos, he stands both to enhance his reputation as a hands-on national leader and gain new respect as a much-needed global statesman.', 'As he functions on his multiple planes, no doubt engaging closely with the issues at hand, he will achieve the best results for India by delegating to people who are competent, trustworthy and fully representative of the country’s diverse constituencies.', 'In so doing, he will make clear that he does not subscribe in any way to the kind of reductive nationalism that has been asserting itself around the world in recent years: India, the world’s largest democracy, is a society rooted in ethnic and religious pluralism. He must present himself incontrovertibly as a leader who is not prepared to compromise his laudable, if ambitious, long-term objectives for the sake of short-term gains achieved through identity populism. He has already committed to achieving transparency, to combating corruption and exploitation, and to creating a more equitable financial and economic framework for his country.

It also says the U.S. will seek to “form enduring coalitions in the Middle East” and expand Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships.', 'The new strategy can be compared in terms of scope to the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review published in February 2010 during the Obama administration.

The company has a letter of intent for the Fieri space from a prestigious tenant at a higher rent, and the operator of the food hall is making final adjustments to its plan, she added, saying the changes are increasing the value of the property and will attract more visitors.', 'A spokeswoman for Gulliver’s Gate said that it “is up to date on their rent and paid in full on their lease” and there are “no concerns” about its future there.', 'Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, left his role in the family company when he joined the administration a year ago and divested from some assets. He says that, to avoid conflict of interest, he’s no longer involved in the business.', 'New managers of the loans bought from Deutsche Bank have taken notice of the property’s issues. Even if they were brief, the missed payments by Gulliver’s Gate, the second most lucrative tenant, triggered a clause in the Kushners’ loan documents allowing creditors to demand any excess cash from the property until the problem was resolved, according to reports from debt servicers. Managers also put the retail space on watch lists for potentially troubled debt because it lost money for nine months through September 2017 after accounting for interest payments, the reports show. That’s because new tenants were given millions in free rent, a common tactic used to fill store spaces. Kushner Cos. set aside $11 million of the loans for the free rent. Disclosures don’t describe that figure as including funds for vacancies.', 'Bumps in the road are common when repositioning buildings, which can take years to reach full earning potential. But the retail tenants at the former New York Times building at 229 West 43rd Street posed special risks.\xa0Disclosures for potential lenders show that none had a credit rating from Fitch, Moody’s Investors Service or S&P Global Inc., unlike many large retail properties that tend to be anchored by stores with known credit profiles.', 'In truth, maintaining full occupancy looked tough from the start. When the debt was sold to investors, the 500-seat Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar had been beset by negativereviews, and Todd English and his partners hadn’t yet taken possession of the space for his food hall. The chef, who haspulled out of another project, was scheduled to open for business there last April. Gulliver’s Gate, reportedly a$40 millionendeavor, had not yet opened and was an untried competitor amid the glitz of Times Square.', 'On a recent Monday afternoon, the area reserved for Todd English was empty and unfinished with no sign of construction. Banners hung outside read “AFI Retail,” the name of a subsidiary of the building’s previous owner.', '“We continue to work towards delivering this project,” Richard A. Chinsammy, executive vice president of Outstanding Hospitality Management Group, English’s partner for the food hall, wrote in an email. A spokeswoman for English said the restaurant is now scheduled to open in December.', 'Logos for Fieri’s restaurant had been ripped from windows, though a large metal sign remained above the doorway. A spokeswoman for Fieri declined to comment.', 'Upstairs, about 50 people were visiting Gulliver’s Gate. Two attendants said it was busier on weekends.\xa0Tickets for the 49,000-square-foot space filled with miniature buildings are $36 for adults and $27 for children and seniors. Tickets are also included with purchases of nearby hotel rooms, according to online reviews.', 'When Kushner Cos.boughtthe property in 2015 from Africa-Israel, the distressed firm of Russian diamond magnate Lev Leviev, online retailers were ascendant, and the future of brick-and-mortar stores was uncertain. So filling the property with tenants offering experiences seemed smart.', 'In addition to Todd English and Gulliver’s Gate, Kushner signed National Geographic, whose “Encounter: Ocean Odyssey”promisesan “incredible underwater journey” without any danger of getting wet. Bowlmor Lanes -- with bowling, an arcade and party spaces -- was already there. Neither tenant has been reported to have any problems.', 'The expected surge in income preceded a new appraisal\xa0in October 2016 at $445 million plus additional cash in accounts, indicating a stunning growth in value that far outstripped the broader Manhattan retail market, which had suffered a slowdown. Against that valuation, the\xa0$370 million of loans represented only 83 percent of the value, the investor disclosures showed. But Moody’s and Kroll, the risk-assessment firm, found\xa0in independent calculations that the loans exceeded the value.', 'Deutsche Bank’s $285 million loan to Kushner Cos. was divided into four trusts with pieces of other loans to be sold to investors as\xa0commercial mortgage-backed securities. All told there are 163 loan pieces in the trusts, but only seven have been flagged on watch lists -- including the four Kushner chunks. The Kushners received another $85 million in high-interest loans from SL Green Realty Corp. and Paramount Group.', 'In determining how much in interest payments the property could handle, underwriters estimated that costs to manage it would run about $4 million, disclosures show. If it achieved full rent of $24 million, that would indicate a modest cushion after making interest payments: about $18 million annually, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But any loss of tenants with no immediate replacements could change those numbers quickly.', 'The situation might get worse before it gets better.\xa0In an October legal complaint against the Plaza Hotel, which contains a Todd English restaurant, the chef is accused of sexual harassment. In November, S&P downgraded the debt of another tenant, Guitar Center, saying it thought a potential debt restructuring could occur in the next six months, “a transaction that we would view as tantamount to a default.” A Guitar Center spokeswoman declined to comment.', 'Entertainment venues are more likely to experience money crunches in an economic slump than traditional retailers, Kroll said in its March report on the property and its debts. “This may subject the loan to increased risk of default and loss,” the firm said.', 'Still, there are worse venues to hunt for new tenants than Times Square, which commands the highest retail rents in the city after Fifth Avenue.', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']"

Then, two days later, herejecteda bipartisan plan for that very deal. This created an impasse, increasing the odds that the government would run out of money and shut down.', 'Though Trump denies changing his position, he no longer seeks a monolithic, 30-foot-tall concrete wall stretching for more than 2,000 miles (3,218 kilometers). Plans now call for a more modest, 722-mile barrier that is a mix of wall and fencing, mostly updating what’s been in place for decades, while relying on drones and other methods to secure the rest.', 'Eight wall prototypes are now being tested in a desert outside San Diego, California. Four are primarily concrete structures, with two made mostly of metal and two others being hybrid designs of concrete, metal bars and steel plating. The mock-ups are being tested for their ability to repel attempts to climb over, smash through or tunnel underneath. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will select the best designs and begin the process of awarding contracts for actual construction once there’s money.', 'Estimates range from as low as $8 billion to as much as $67 billion or more, depending on whom you ask and the number of miles of wall that get built. Based on Trump’s 2017 budget request for $2.6 billion to plan, design and build 75 miles of wall, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill’s officeestimatedthe per-mile cost would be about $37 million, or nearly $67 billion for the entire 2,000-mile border. Congressional Republicans have said they expect a wall to cost from$12 billion to $15 billion, based on the cost to rebuild existing border fencing covering a third of that distance. These projections, however, don’t include the cost of land acquisition.', 'Far from it. Two-thirds of the land is private or state-owned, much of it in Texas. The Trump administration could seek to use eminent domain to seize land needed for a border barrier, as well as support roads and other infrastructure, though it would likely face costly legal challenges that could delay construction for years.', 'Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has emphatically refused to fund the border wall. Trump has suggested that the U.S. can recoup wall expenses from Mexico via alternative methods, including bycuttingits trade surplus with the U.S. He’s also floated the option of invoking the Patriot Act to cut off or tax remittance payments to Mexico from Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. Mexicans sent home$25.7 billion in remittancesin 2016, according to the Banco de Mexico.', 'If Mexico can’t be made to pay, U.S. taxpayers, most likely.', 'Barriers span 653 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, mostly along the western half. Much of the southern borders of California, Arizona and New Mexico have existing barriers, ranging from 18-foot-tall iron fencing and corrugated metal to makeshift vehicle barriers and barbed wire.', 'Most experts doubt that a physical wall would do much to reduce the $150 billion in illegal drugs that pour into the country each year. As part of a set of tools to combat illegal immigration, however, physical barriers could help.

Revenue in the newer businesses “missed whisper expectations,” which disappointed the most bullish scenarios, he said.', 'IBM reported fourth-quarter sales of $11.1 billion in “strategic imperatives” -- those newer products and services in cloud, analytics, security and mobile. While that was up 17 percent from a year earlier, it was just in line with the average estimate and many were hoping for more, Ives said.', 'IBM shares were down 3.3 percent at 7:16 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York Friday.', 'Much of the growth fueling IBM’s $22.5 billion in fourth-quarter revenue came from its new mainframe servers. Customers from banks to health-care companies are buying the hardware and accompanying software\xa0for their own data centers to run large applications -- from financial transactions to customer billing. That should help keep pumping up revenue over the next couple of quarters, analysts said. But IBM will have to show that gains in its newer software and services will help it keep growing even when the bump from hardware sales fades.', '“It’s possible that organic growth may be back to flat in the second half of this year, once the benefit from the mainframe refresh cycle goes away,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana. “If you exclude the contribution from mainframes, growth would be flat to negative, which is in line with the past few quarters.”', 'Sales, which increased 3.6 percent in the period, topped the average analyst estimate of $22.06 billion.\xa0International Business Machines Corp. had forecast the growth in October. IBM said it took a one-time charge of $5.5 billion as a result of the new U.S. tax law, which weighed on profit. In addition, the company said it expects its tax rate to rise in 2018 as a result of the bill, which includes a lower corporate tax rate offset by a broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization.', 'The tax headwinds, combined with the one-time charge, threw “one big wrench in the wheel” and could also be why investors are reacting negatively, said David Holt, an analyst at CFRA Research.', 'Profit, excluding some items, was $5.18 a share in the quarter. Analysts projected $5.17. IBM fell 1 cent short of the average analyst estimate of $13.81 a share for the full year. Under generally accepted accounting principles, IBM reported a loss for the quarter including the tax charge. The shares fell as much as 4.8 percent to $161 in extended trading.', 'Over the last six years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty assured investors that she would refocus IBM’s business on emerging technologies -- such as cloud and artificial intelligence -- and stem the revenue decline. She shed units, invested in cloud data centers and bought a number of companies to boost sales, bolster technology offerings and add troves of data to help train AI algorithms. But those investments have yet to pay off, and analysts have said that IBM’s turnaround is still in the works.', 'The shares took abeatinglast year, after the company missed sales estimates in the first half. The stock then rallied the mostsince 2009after the company forecast revenue would increase in the fourth quarter. Analysts have said that shows investors care most about getting back to sales growth. One quarter of expansion doesn’t a successful turnaround make, and it’s now critical for IBM to sustain improving revenue this year.', '“Revenue growth has been what investors have been wanting to see,” Holt said. “When you pull back the layers, all the segments are churning, and fundamentals are pointing in the right direction.”', 'The companyprojectedrevenue growth in 2018, regardless of currency trends. New Chief Financial Officer\xa0Jim Kavanaugh said that will be achieved in part by gains in software-as-a-service as well as IBM’s global business services operations -- an area that has struggled in recent years.', 'Rometty had set a goal for IBM to reach $40 billion in strategic imperative revenue this year, which would mean those newer products would make up more than half of the company’s business. Kavanaugh said the company will achieve that goal and continue to increase strategic imperative sales at least at a percentage in the the double digits.', 'Should IBM increase revenue in global business services as promised by the end of the year, that would reverse continuous declines of more than a year, Holt said. This is an area IBM has invested heavily in to shift the focus and skills of its employees onto projects in digital and cloud-based technologies.', 'Gross margins were 49.5 percent, missing the average analyst estimate of 50.9 percent, in part because measures to cut expenses took longer to pay off, the company said. While margins improved sequentially as promised, this is the ninth straight quarter that they shrank compared with the same period the prior year. Gross margins will stabilize this year, helped by the expense cutting, higher sales in more profitable products and increased scale on the cloud business, Kavanaugh said. However, currency hedges and plans to continue investing will offset some of that benefit, he said.', 'Revenue from the systems unit, which houses hardware and operating systems software, grew 32 percent. Typically an area of decline, sales of mainframe servers, as well as accompanying software, helped boost the group.', 'Sales in the cognitive solutions unit, which houses analytics software and the AI products branded under Watson, grew 2.5 percent to $5.4 billion. Technology services and cloud platforms, the unit that includes IBM’s cloud infrastructure and platform offerings as well as its consulting business, posted a revenue decline of 1.2 percent, in part because some of its legacy software sales with bigger upfront revenue shifted to the cloud.', 'Last week, IBM named Kavanaugh to be the new CFO, while Martin Schroeter will be taking on a new role as the senior vice president of global markets.

A host of new limits on the fuel’s use in India, including bans and increased taxes, have been adopted after refiners in the fastest growing oil consumer built plants to process the “bottom of the barrel” fuel.', '“Petcoke will be a big challenge in 2018,” Indian Oil Finance Director Arun Kumar Sharma said in an interview in New Delhi. “We have to prepare ourselves for an alternative plan.”', 'Indian refiners aren’t alone in their struggle to deal with the various environmental regulations sweeping the region. With tighter emissionscontrolsfrom China toIndonesia, oil processors across Asia are being rocked by constantly changing rules on what they can produce as governments strive to breathe clean air into some of the world’s most polluted cities.', 'Petcoke took off in India after the government began limiting coal use to reduce carbon emissions. Consumption of the oil residue has quadrupled since 2011, with the fuel being used by cement manufacturers, captive power generators, and small manufacturing industries who see it as a low-cost coal alternative. Last year, India used 25 million tons of petcoke, making the country the world’s biggest market for the crude waste product, with imports from the U.S. to China surging.', '“Since coal can be substituted by petcoke, the usage in cement industries increased in India, especially after imported coal prices rose in the recent years,” said Satnam Singh, director for energy at CRISIL Infrastructure Advisory.', 'During that time, Indian Oil\xa0built the world’s largest delayed-coker unit with the ability to produce as much as 1.3 million tons of petcoke a year. The state-run refiner now has similar units across seven of its nine refineries and isinvesting$480 million to add another in eastern India. The plants enable Indian Oil to process the heavy, high-sulfur crude, or the worst of the oil, and turn it into higher quantities of a more valuable product.', 'Then petcoke began facing its own issues.

Pollution in New Delhi skyrocketed last year, with the level of deadly carcinogenic pollutants roughly 10 times than in Beijing.', 'As public opposition mounted, India’s top court banned the use of petcoke in Delhi and three neighboring states\xa0in October, with the Supreme Court adding it would like to see its use prohibited across the country. The government also removed tax exemptions and raised the levy on its imports last month.', '“Eventually, similar pollution-impact effects will spread to the rest of the country,” said Virendra Chauhan, an analyst at industry consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. “Indian Oil will have to look at long-term solutions to keep operations running.”', 'Indian Oil could turn to Reliance Industries Ltd. for inspiration. The rival refiner, which produces half of the country’s total production of petcoke at 13 million tons a year, has found use for the unwanted fuel. The company is estimated to have spent as much as $5 billion building a gasification unit that will convert petcoke into environment friendly synthetic gas, which can be used to generate power for running its plants.', 'Indian Oil’s Chairman Sanjiv Singh said last month that the company is looking into building a gasification unit. However, Sharma is concerned about finding a quicker fix. Gasification units are a long-term solution, he says, but in the mean time, sending it to other parts of the country or abroad may be its best option despite the risk of shipping costs impacting profits.', '“As an immediate solution, we have to think about disposal only, say to other parts of the country or through exports,” Sharma said. “We will have to be watchful on this.
