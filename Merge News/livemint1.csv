Its sales in the domestic market during the April-December period grew by 15.5% at 12,26,418 units as against 10,61,873 units in the year-ago period. It will launch the all-new version of its popular hatchback Swift at the upcoming Auto Expo to be held from 9-14 February.', 'According to sources, besides the new Swift, the company plans to introduce a new refreshed version of its mid-sized sedan, Ciaz and multiple purpose vehicle Ertiga in the coming months. “An all new version of compact car Wagon R is also in the pipeline but its launch timeline hasn’t been fixed,” a source said.', 'Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) R S Kalsi, however, declined to comment on the company’s launch programme for the next fiscal. “That’s a continuous process and we cannot comment on which one will come when,” he told PTI when asked about the upcoming new product introductions in the market.', 'Commenting on the company’s performance in the ongoing fiscal, he said in the April-December period the company’s sales have grown by 15.3% but the growth rate will be lesser in the fourth quarter due to high base effect of the year-ago period. “We will end the year on healthy double digit growth. Last six years we have been growing more than the industry. The best part is that this will be the fifth year of double digit growth in a row, which is quite an achievement,” Kalsi said.', 'He said the company has been able to sustain its growth momentum in the last few years despite challenges of two consecutive droughts in many parts of India that had an impact on rural markets and policy disruption such as demonetisation and impact of GST implementation.', 'Currently the industry growth is at 8.13% and MSI is confident that it would be ahead of the industry again, he added. When asked about the outlook for 2018-19, Kalsi said, “We expect the similar momentum to continue for the industry. We do not foresee any disruption”. However, for Maruti Suzuki, he said, “We are yet to present our budget to the top management, we are yet to work out our budget for next year. So, commenting on a number for next year will not be possible”.', 'The company is confident that new products like the upcoming Swift will help in adding more volumes. “On the first year of its launch Swift did one lakh units. Subsequent to that, the outgoing Swift has been selling on an average of 15,000 units a month. This (the new one) being many steps above that, we expect the market demand will be more than that,” Kalsi added.', 'The company’s parent Suzuki has spent around Rs 800 crore on the development of the new Swift. The new vehicle will so be produced at Suzuki’s Gujarat plant along with Baleno, besides MSI’s Manesar plant.']"

Annadurai and E.V. Ramasamy. Photo: Wikimedia Commons,"['In 1967, as a green Indira Gandhi watched in dismay, the Congress government was voted out of power in Tamil Nadu. Even venerable leaders like then chief minister M. Bhaktavatsalam and prime ministerial kingmaker and national Congress president K. Kamaraj bit the dust as the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) under C.N. Annadurai came to power with a thumping two-thirds majority.', 'After 1967, the Congress has never held power in the southern state. For the past 50 years, power in Tamil Nadu has seesawed between the two Dravidian parties—the DMK and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The Congress has always been an also-ran. Its loss of power had much to do with something that the party had become closely identified with two years earlier which had met with severe opposition in the state. The issue was that of Hindi, its status in the country and more specifically, in Tamil Nadu.', 'On 25 January 1965, the students of Madras University went on strike in protest against the imminent imposition of English with Hindi as mandated by the Constitution. When the Constitution had come into force on 26 January 1950, it had provided for a 15-year waiting period before Hindi would become the sole official language of the nation. In the interim, both Hindi and English would function as official languages.', 'The 15-year period was to come to an end on 26 January 1965. This deadline had always been viewed in Tamil Nadu with some trepidation. Occasionally, the state and its leaders’ anti-Hindi stance led to humourous repartee. In response to a Hindi zealot’s claim that Hindi deserved to be made India’s national language since its speakers were the most numerous, Annadurai is said to have retorted that on the basis of that logic, the crow ought to be India’s national bird and not the peacock. But feelings about the language issue went way beyond that.', 'In 1963, as many as three “Anti-Hindi” conferences had been held in the state with a view to lobbying for the continuation of English. But now with the deadline almost upon them, the demands became more strident and also soon took a morbid turn.', 'On the 25th, there were protest marches in most towns and cities in Tamil Nadu. Over 50,000 people marched peacefully in Madras (now Chennai). Protestors held placards and banners against Hindi imposition and raised slogans. In Coimbatore, “pall bearers” carried a mock “dead body” of the Hindi demon, accompanied by “wailing” students.', 'Soon however, things turned violent. Violence against protestors by pro-Hindi forces (reportedly, goons in the pay of the Congress) erupted and there were clashes in several places. The police opened fire to quell the violence resulting in deaths. In parallel, there were self-immolations by young men and gruesome and gut-wrenching deaths accompanied by the slogans, “Tamil Vazhuga! Hindi Ozhiga!” (Long live Tamil! Death to Hindi!)', ""An agitated Bhaktavatsalam and an even more perturbed prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, attempted to allay fears about Hindi imposition. For close to two weeks, the state seethed and boiled and only by mid-February did the situation return to a semblance of normalcy when forced by the resignation of two Tamil ministers from his ministry, Shastri went on radio and assured the people that he would abide by Nehru's promise to keep English in use as long as the people wanted."", 'The Tamil writer Sujatha’s story Coconuts (without actually naming the state or language) captures the zeitgeist of that time. A young couple returning from a holiday in the hills stop at a wayside stall to buy coconut water. Forgetting himself, the young man asks the old vendor, “Kitna?” provoking a few men shooting the breeze nearby into action. Things get out of hand and soon enough, there is violence. The merest mention of a word had incited passions. Such was the deep-rooted anti Hindi sentiment of that time.', 'Before 1965', 'The year 1965 wasn’t the first instance of anti-Hindi agitations in the state. The first anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu was held in 1937. As per the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935, the colonial government had introduced a measure of self-government in the provinces. Under its auspices, a ministry headed by Rajaji (C. Rajagopalachari, later independent India’s first and last Indian governor-general) came to power in the multi-lingual Madras Presidency (as it was then) which included areas from all the southern states.', 'Among its more controversial measures was to introduce Hindi as a compulsory subject in schools. It was viewed as an affront both to the Tamil language and the Tamil literary tradition, which was arguably older and richer than Hindi. Among its most fervent opponents was Periyar (E.V. Ramaswami Naicker). The protests put the Rajaji government in a quandary.', 'As part of its anti-colonial struggle, the Congress had made known its preference for Hindi (Hindustani) in preference to English. The Motilal Nehru Committee report of 1928 had suggested Hindi as a possible official language after independence. Gandhi had founded the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha with a view to popularizing Hindi in the southern states.', 'The introduction of Hindi by the Rajaji government was therefore in line with the Congress’s agenda to create a national identity for Indians which while encouraging all Indian languages would be posited on Hindi as a “link language” and a tool for national unity. The idea was to cast aside English, which was viewed as a colonial imposition.', 'The fervor of the anti-Hindi movement however caught Rajaji unawares. In a bid to diffuse the movement, the Congress ministry announced that though Hindi would be taught compulsorily in schools, there was to be no examination in the subject and the total time devoted for teaching Hindi would be only a couple of hours each week. This did not pacify the opposition. Protests continued for the next two years.', 'It is interesting to consider why Hindi was viewed with such suspicion. The opposition to Hindi was in part a reaction against caste. Colonial rule in the Madras Presidency had created an indefensible anomaly. Brahmins, not more than 3% of the Presidency’s population had cornered a great number of government jobs, were highly preponderant in modern professions such as law and medicine and also constituted the bulk of the Congress leadership. They were also seen as people who systematically blocked entry to claimants from other castes.', 'Brahmins in the Tamil-speaking regions also spoke a Sanskrit-laced Tamil which, in the view of many, placed them in a position of advantage vis-à-vis Hindi. That Congress eminences like Rajaji were Brahmin and also reasonably fluent Hindi speakers was a fact not lost on the public. Hindi imposition was viewed as a Brahminical conspiracy to keep the lower castes in their thrall and this was unacceptable.', 'Periyar, the leader of the 1937 movement had himself left the Congress in disgust in 1925 after he was convinced that the Congress was insufficiently committed to the question of caste equality. By the late ‘30s, he was in the forefront of what had come to be known as the Self-Respect Movement which was vehemently opposed to Brahmin domination.', 'In part, ‘Hindi’ was a stand-in for ‘Brahmin’ and opposition to Hindi was a way of registering a protest against Brahmin domination. Equally, there was the notion of the south Indian ‘Dravidian’ being a counterpoint to the north Indian ‘Aryan’. Hindi was a North Indian language and both North Indians and Hindi’s southern supporters, the Brahmins, were of presumed ‘Aryan’ stock or origins.', 'It was the heyday then of the Aryan Invasion Theory. In Nehru’s Discovery of India (published only later in 1946, but which encapsulates the prevalent historical ideas of the time well), he writes of the ‘Aryans’, “… who poured into India in successive waves from the north-west.” He also talks of the ‘Dravidians’ being the possible “…representatives of the Indus Valley Civilization.” Viewed thus, it was a battle of the ‘sons of the soil’ against the usurpers. As Periyar put it, Hindi was an agent of ‘continuing Aryan, Brahminic, Sanskritic imperialism.’', 'In February 1940, the government issued a notification bringing to an end the provision for compulsory teaching of Hindi in schools. (The Rajaji Congress ministry had by then resigned protesting the involvement of India in the Second World War.) The anti-Hindi campaign ceased, only to erupt again twenty-five years later in 1965.', 'Post-1965, Tamil Nadu continues to look askance at the machinations of politicians from Delhi. The fear of North Indian domination has continued as has the opposition to Hindi. The ‘jallikattu’ protests which pulverized Tamil Nadu in early 2017 were viewed by many commentators as emerging out of the politics of opposition to Hindi imperialism and North Indian domination.', 'Karthik Venkatesh is an editor with a publishing firm and a freelance writer.

Until recently it was the world’s 8th largest producers of coal in the world.', 'The contrast with nuclear energy, which is commonly perceived to the riskiest source of energy, could not be starker.

If you have not heard about this incident before that is because the Chinese government made itpubliconly 30 years later in 2005, when it declassified secret government files.', 'When deaths per unit of electricity are considered, accidents due to coal kill between 2.8 and 32.7 people per 10 billion killowatt-hour. Compared to this, deaths caused by accidents involving hydropower ranges between 1 and 54.7. However, in the case of nuclear energy accidents, deaths per unitrangesbetween 0.1 and 1.2.', 'Ever since the commercialisation of nuclear energy as a source of power in the 1950s, the first major nuclear accident was in the year 1961 at Idaho Falls in the U.S., where 3 workers lost their lives. The next major accident was in 1979, when the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear accident took place in the U.S. While there were no immediate deaths in this case, a few studies have shown a long-term impact on the health of local residents due to an increased incidence of cancer, although other studies dispute these claims.', 'The gravest nuclear energy accident took place in Chernobyl (now in Ukraine) in 1986. There were 30 deaths due to the accident directly, but the long-term mortality is significantly higher. The World Health Organisation estimated that there will be 9,000 long-term premature deaths due to this accident.', 'The Fukushima accident, which triggered Germany’s U-turn on nuclear energy, is also expected to have a long-term impact on mortality in the region. One study predicts around 130 premature deaths attributable to the accident and another 180 cases of cancer.', 'Tragically, the fear of nuclear accidents in Fukushima led to more deaths than the accident itself. Nearly 300,000 people in the Fukushima prefecture were evacuated in the aftermath of the nuclear meltdown. This displacement led to over 1,600 deaths – many of which were of senior citizens – not due to radiation but due to fatigue, illness andhospital closures.  A study estimated that if there had been no mandatory evacuations, the radiation itself would have claimed between 3 to 245 lives over the next 28 years,far lowerthan the deaths due to evacuation.', 'Like in the case of nuclear accidents, mortality figures due to accidents in fossil fuel based energy sources do not reveal the true extent of the risk involved. Much of the risk that emanate from fossil fuel sources are in the form of externalities – and they impact people at large whether or not there has been an accident. An externality is defined as a consequence of an activity that affects an entity that has not chosen to be party to that activity.', 'In the case of fossil fuels, the externality in the production and consumption of energy arise from the pollutants that are produced in the process of their use, such as fine particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen oxide.', 'Air pollution in its various forms canlead tolung and throat cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, low birth weight, tuberculosis, cataracts, asthma, bronchial disease, reduced lung function and heart diseases.', 'In Germany alone, air pollution – from automobiles, coal fired power plants and other sources – claims 70,000 lives prematurely every year. There are over 450,000 premature deathsannuallyin Europe and 6.5 million around the world.  The numbers are indeed staggering. When air pollution deaths due to different sources of energy are considered along with accident deaths, coal yet again proves to be the deadliest. Coal leads to about 28 deaths per unit (terawatt-hour) of electricity, petroleum leads to about 17, natural gas to 4, and nuclear leads tonearly zero.', 'In fact, when it comes to the total greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced, nuclear technologies fares evenbetterthan solar energy. While coal produces 888 tonnes of greenhouse gases per unit (gigawatt-hour) of electricity, natural gas produces 449, solar produces 85 tonnes and nuclear energy only 29 tonnes.', 'While nuclear energy gets much of the attention due to its lack of safety, other conventional sources of energy have clearly proven, so far, to be far more hazardous to human health. The energy transition in Germany – and elsewhere – has been reasoned to be a transition away from unsafe nuclear energy and global warming causing fossil fuels, when the reality is that it is fossil fuels that have proven to be both a cause of climate change as well as risks to human health.', 'The mushroom cloud', 'In August 1945, when an American B-29 bomber dropped the nuclear bomb ironically named “Little Boy” on Hiroshima in Japan, it was to change the trajectory of world history. The bomb exploded about 2000 feet above the ground, sending shockwaves for miles and obliterating everything in sight. Between 90,000 and 150,000 people lost their lives in the first ever use of a nuclear weapon. The mushroom cloud that emerged was forever imprinted in the memories of those who witnessed it.', 'Since then, there have been several nuclear explosions in the form of another bomb at Nagasaki and later, nuclear tests in the Cold War era. These events have been televised and have illustrated to the world the devastating impact that a nuclear bomb can have.', 'Nuclear energy for peaceful purposes has forever lived in the shadow of the devastating nuclear mushroom cloud. With every following accident – be it the Three Mile Island in 1979 or Chernobyl in 1986 – people have expected the worst. The public perception of nuclear energy is largely negative. According to surveys Only 15% of Germans are ‘mainly or very’ positive about nuclear energy, compared to 40% in the U.K. On the other hand, approval rates of natural gas and hydroelectric power is 50% and 85% among Germans. Curiously, at 22% positive attitudes, more Germansprefercoal over nuclear energy, in spite of coal posing a significantly greater risk overall.', 'Much like how people are more likely to fear air travel more than road travel even though the former is far safer, nuclear energy is feared more than coal even though the latter takes more lives. The reasons for the negative public perceptions towards nuclear energy are manifold. First and foremost, Germany has had a tremulous geopolitical history in the aftermath of the world wars, which has impacted the perception of nuclear energy. West and East Germany became the principal theatres of the Cold War. As the U.S. and Soviet Union rattled their nuclear sabres, Germans were well aware that their two states would be a key battleground in a potential conflict. The threat of nuclear annihilation loomed large in this period as NATO troops from the U.S., France and U.K. were equipped with nuclear weapons on German soil.', 'There were many small scale nuclear reactors constructed in the 1960s in West Germany, although the first commercial operations began in 1969. In the 1970s, anti-American left-leaning student movements began equating nuclear power to capitalism and militarism. The slogan “Atomkraft? Nein Danke”, which translates to, “Nuclear Power? No thank you” became popular. The slogan was accompanied with the symbol a laughing sun. This slogan and logo found its way onto T-shirts and stickers, thereby popularising the anti-nuclear sentiment. The Green Party in Germany emerged from these student movements, thereby creating a potent anti-nuclearpolitical force.', 'Future generations of Germans too have consumed mainstream anti-nuclear art and literature, such as the popular fictional book for teenagers titled “Die Wolke” (“The Cloud”) published in 1987, which tells the story of a cloud of radiation following a nuclear accident at a power station within Germany. And as recently as 2011, there were violent clashes with the police, asprotesterstried blocking nuclear shipments that were arriving by rail from France.', 'Secondly, in the aftermath of Chernobyl, the perceived risks from nuclear energy really hit home for many Germans. Parents, in particular, felt “personally threatened” when higher than normal radioactivity was measured around and in the kindergartens where their young children studied. Further, radioactivity from rain entered the food cycle. The radioactivity first entered the cycle through hay which was consumed by cows, and then into the milk that Germans bought from shops and fed themselves and their children.', 'Relatedly, in erstwhile East Germany, Uranium miners and communities around mines have first-hand experience of environmental degradation in the form of sludge in water bodies and radioactive waste piles around uranium mines. An estimated 400,000 workers worked in these mines in poor safety conditions, supplying the Soviet nuclear complex. There was an increase in theincidenceof lung cancer among workers in the mines. The mines were later shut down and these wastelands were later cleaned up withfinancingfrom the unified German government.', 'A third reason for the German lack of appetite for nuclear energy is due to poor communication by the nuclear industry and government itself. The technology and risks from nuclear and other forms of energy have not historically been communicated to the people effectively. Take for instance in 1975, when anti-nuclear protests were taking place in Germany.', 'In the run-up to the referendum in Wyhl, a nuclear engineer working for the government explained to the public that a nuclear power plant is similar to a tea pot. “You pour water in, and steam comes out the top. And see, nothing else happens”, he said, to an unconvinced audience, some of who had already done a bit of their own research. Naturally, this created distrust between the two groups.', 'Amusingly, elsewhere in Menzenschwand in the Black Forest, supporters of uranium mining in the 1960s argued that a “radioactive spa” could be created in the region using radon, which they claimed had health benefits. There were even radioactive chocolate bars available called ‘Burkbraun Radium Schokolade’, and the manufacturers claimed that it made people younger.', 'Lies, damned lies, and Chernobyl. All have helped to create an aversion in Germany towards nuclear power. Over the years, people realised these health benefits do not hold\xa0and naturally, the distrust of the nuclear industry and government support of it continued.', 'In astudypublished in 1992 on the aftermath of Chernobyl, scholars Alexander Shlyakhter and Richard Wilson aptly wrote, “Bureaucrats in all countries like to hide their incompetence and lack of understanding in secrecy. The justification ‘the people will not understand’ often means that the bureaucrat does not understand.”', 'Siddharth Singh, a researcher of energy and the economy, wrote this series of articles as a German Chancellor fellow and a visiting fellow at the Wuppertal Institute in Berlin.

Folk tales and superstition abound with these often sinister characters in various forms and guises.', 'Given the fear associated witchcraft, though, accusations of being a witch have been used across the world to target the weak—especially women. India is no different from any other country in this regard; interestingly, though, while there is no shortage of oral histories, we don’t see much in the way of archival records.', 'One reason for this is that the British banned witch-hunting in India around the 1850s. As a result, accusations of witchcraft were kept under wraps and very few cases made it to the British courts. Usually, the local law enforcement dealt with them. Those records are scanty, scattered and often lost.', 'Further, locating the historical narrative within a larger context is tricky. Witchcraft practices vary across regions, and the background of the practitioners depend on their cultural environment and economic strata. Writing a comprehensive history of witchcraft in India, therefore, is extremely challenging.', 'However, that doesn’t mean we can’t glean a few interesting insights. Of particular note is the Mandi Report, compiled in 1888, which documents numerous cases of witch-hunting from 1850 to the 1880s among the “Bheels who lived in the hilly tracts of Meywar”.', 'The Mandi Report can be best described as an umbrella project under which several cases were filed. It was put together to demonstrate the effectiveness of British rule in banning witch-hunting and a form of torture known as “witch-swinging”. The report contains 15 cases, highlighting the British efforts to “civilize” India.', 'The tone of the report varied from case to case, depending on the author; many of them, though, display genuine compassion, which led them to thoroughly investigate the deaths of women that were usually neglected by the local courts. In fact, there is evidence to suggest the courts’ active role in silencing these cases.', 'The first step in the witch-hunt was consulting the witch-finder or the bhopa. Only he could ascertain if someone was actually a witch. The bhopa chants various incantations to verify the people’s suspicions. If he declared the accused a witch, a few chosen men gagged and bound her.', 'The hapless woman would be brought under a banyan tree, and her eyes covered with a poultice of red chili paste. She would then be swung from the tree, often upside-down, from daybreak to evening. After that, she was untied, taken back to her home or held somewhere else, only to be brought back the next day to repeat the process.', 'The entire village would turn out to witness the swinging, an important social event. Usually, it went on for weeks. If the woman survived the ordeal, the outcome varied. Frequently, she was either forced to leave the village or face ostracism. In rare cases, though, she was freed of the accusation and received a reward, like a new sari or some sweetmeat.', '***', 'The case of an elderly woman named Eullal, in the Mandi Report, illustrates the usual series of events.', 'A young man named Koobla, who lived in the village of Chhabra in Edur district. Koobla died in September 1850 after a prolonged illness, and his brother, Kooshal, was convinced that the person responsible for his death was Eullal.', 'She had bewitched him and watched him die a slow, painful death, Kooshal claimed. He decided to alert the village authorities. The inevitable happened, and Eullal, who was old and frail, did not survive the swinging for even a whole day.', 'Eullal’s story would have been lost like many others, had someone not reported the incident to a certain Captain Brooke, the Political Agent of the region, who decided to take action. Brooke treated the incident as murder, and ordered Eullal’s body be exhumed. They found traces of chili paste on her body and a large wound on her chest. Kooshal admitted to making the chili paste and applying it, but said he had no knowledge of the chest wound.', 'In the end, Brooke failed to apprehend the bhopa and the other men involved in swinging. All he could do was impose a fine on the entire village, although he later asked his superiors to pardon this fine since the poor villagers would never be able to pay it.', 'The most long-drawn-out of the cases in the Mandi Report took place in 1872, involving a low-ranking government official, Kadur Bohra. This was referred to as the “Kushalgarh case”, in which an 80-year-old woman named Chhadoo was swung for days until she died.', 'The Political Agent of the area, Franjee Bheekajee, started investigating it as a murder case because there were rumours of bribery behind this swinging. Chhadoo had been financially stable, and owned a hut and some cattle. The investigation quickly showed that the village headman and a few influential members of the village council had colluded to target her. It was deemed a planned, cold-blooded murder, and Bohra, the official, had been bribed to not report the swinging to the authorities.', 'The investigation continued for two years, and ended with the imprisonment of the main culprits, namely the government official, the village head and the witch-finder. This is the only case in the report in which the culprits were brought to justice.', 'And then in 1883, in Kankend, a village in the Banswarah territory, a young woman named Dulloo was swung for more than a month; she had been accused of causing the death of her brother-in-law’s child. Dulloo, however, survived the ordeal and all charges against her were dropped. She then received a new sari and sweetmeats as a reward. Out of the cases recorded in the Mandi Report, this is the only one in which the would-be witch was declared innocent. Since witch-swinging was illegal, the men responsible were tried in the court, but no one was convicted.', 'The next year, three women from the nearby village of Katie Dour were accused of witchcraft. All three were swung for a week, declared guilty and forced to leave the village. The women decided to appeal to the British court for justice and managed to get compensation of Rs200, which helped them to settle in another village.', 'Apart from this case and Dulloo’s, every instance of witch-swinging detailed in the Mandi Report ended in the death of the accused woman or women. One possible reason why these three had survived was that they were all young (as was Dulloo), in their early 20s. Most women accused of being witches were elderly widows. Given their age and bodily infirmity, they were unable to survive the trauma of witch-swinging.', 'Another common characteristic of the “witches” was that they were economically independent. Even today, most women accused of witchcraft are usually independent and have considerable wealth. Archana Mishra in her book, Casting the Evil Eye: Witch Trials in Tribal India, highlights that property disputes, inheritance and other financial matters are often resolved by falsely accusing the woman of practising witchcraft.', '***', 'Like all archival records, the British records are biased. A pinch of salt would be prudent. Nonetheless, these stories need to be told, especially because they involved intricate legal processes.', 'Significantly, the British had not banned the practice of witchcraft, but prohibited witch-finding. The intention behind this was to protect women, and we know of at least three (the ones from Katie Dour) who used this to their advantage.', 'The Mandi Report helps bridge the gap between religious knowledge and actual practice over the years in India, and provides a backdrop to understanding current sorcery practices. Indeed, archival records play a critical role in removing the fanciful aspect from witchcraft, help us comprehend the seriousness of it and lay the foundation for the growth of more complex historical narratives.', 'References:', 'Mandi Report, 1850-1880 (British Library) E/4/33/W88.']"

I love Skoob for several reasons. First of all its name is the word books in reverse. Cool bro. Second, they always have cheap used copies of Lindsey Davis novels. Third, there is absolutely zero cellular signal down in the basement of the Brunswick Building, where the store is to be found. So your phone never rings, pings or vibrates. A silent phone is not only good for reading, it is also great for browsing shelves upon shelves of books. Fourth, for such a large store it always seems to have fresh stock when I go there. I am never bored at Skoob. And finally they always, always, always have something I want to read. It could be a frothy little crime novel. Or a thoroughly daunting two-volume set of Braudel on the Mediterranean.', 'I pop in at Skoob once a month or so. And I always buy something. Not because I have to. I am the kind of guy who can spend two hours in a bookstore, and then leave in a thoroughly good mood without having bought a thing. So Skoob is really great. And the prices are excellent.', 'I really do love used bookstores. And in no small part because of the stuff I keep finding inside used books.', 'Many years ago, I bought a short history of Islam, or something in that ilk, from a used bookstore next to a church somewhere in Wales. And inside the book the previous owner had carefully placed several cuttings on Bangladesh. They were all from the 1970s and all made dire predictions for the country. I am glad to inform that Bangladesh appears to have belied all these expectations.', 'Some months ago I bought another non-fiction book, the details of which I shall leave anonymous for obvious reasons. It was an online purchase, and on opening the packet I realized that the book was a first edition, signed by the author, and presented to yet another author. Why? Because the second author had agreed to blurb the book. Thus the guy with his name on the front had signed the book for the guy whose name was on the back. Who, for whatever reason, had decided to sell the book on. And, thirty years later, it had found its way to me.', 'So what did I do? I tracked down the author of the book, now a respected don in a college at Oxford, and sent him an email. Some weeks later, following his invitation, I went to Oxford to watch a film and then witness a panel discussion. Afterwards he walked over and we spoke for several minutes. It was thoroughly amazing.', 'Over the years I have found all kinds of things inside used books. Peacock feathers. Newspaper cuttings. Bus tickets. Receipts. Personal notes. Recipes. A Christmas shopping list, compiled in 1993, for someone with a massive and diverse family: Mr Smith, Aunt Jane, Uncle Amjad, Mr Mohan, et cetera.', 'Once, many, many years ago, we moved from one flat in Abu Dhabi to another one, and I found an old Bible high up inside a cupboard built into the wall. It was a little bit creepy. I have vivid memories of sitting and reading that Bible cover to cover over a summer vacation. It had belonged to an American lady at some point. And the book was full of annotations and little notes and highlighted passages. And phone numbers.', 'My most recent discovery inside a used book happened during my last trip to Skoob. I purchased a copy of Lindsey Davis’s seventh novel in the Falco series—Time to Depart—and on the train back home discovered the most delicious things inside. First there were a set of airplane boarding passes for a couple—a doctor of some type and his wife—from Ayers Rock to Cairns. Ayers Rock! In Australia! I’d read about Ayers Rock in a textbook in school. Magic. The trip took place on 14 September. Of some year.', 'It is a Qantas boarding pass and a special logo in a corner reads “Proud Sponsor of The Australian Olympic Team”.', 'But which Olympics was this? The boarding passes looked ancient. Ten years old? Maybe 15?', 'The other item in the book offered a clue, though. It was a ‘Regular Adult’ admission ticket for a Cezanne show held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Dated 20 July 1996. The book itself was printed in 1996.', 'So this is what I think happened. Twenty years ago a couple from Australia bought a copy of Time to Depart, and then took it with them on a trip to the US. Where they visited the Cezanne show… but could they have also attended some of the events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics? The dates would certainly allow it. Perhaps they had so much fun on the trip that, two months later, he or she was still reading the book as they travelled around Australia.', 'Two decades later, somehow, the book went up for sale at the Skoob bookstore in London. Where I picked it up. And will now carry with me for months and perhaps years to come. I say that because I never sell on any of my books. I hoard. And assemble shelves. And fill boxes. Lend. And lose. But I never sell on my books.', 'But you know what? Maybe I should. And I should leave clues for the next buyer. So that they can take the little imaginary journeys, fantastic pilgrimages, brilliant adventures, and fanciful leaps of imagination that I go on every time I find a used book with things inside.', 'Used books are the best. You get two or three stories for half the price of one.', 'Letter From... isMint on Sunday’s antidote to boring editor’s columns.

As the president of Ukraine’s National Olympic Committee and the senior vice president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, he leads the life of the sports administrator, dealing with athletes’ training, uniforms, ticketing, replying to correspondence and planning for the future.', 'Pretty mundane stuff, which hides behind its seeming ordinariness, an athlete who was once the world’s best, who defied gravity and had an impossibility of achievements—with the secret of his prowess shrouded behind the mystery of the Iron Curtain.', 'The setter of 35 pole vault world records (17 outdoor, 18 indoor) in the space of a decade in the 1980s and early 1990s, whose leap of 6.15 metres (indoor) set in 1993 could only be beaten 21 years later, has moved smoothly into a different role with the same meticulous planning that defined his sporting career.', '“You need to understand that one day you will retire so you have to be prepared,” he says softly, in thickly accented English. “Prepared not just mentally, but for the future too. So when you retire, you are busy, and have new goals. You should not wake up and say, ‘Oh, what will I do tomorrow?’ It’s too late already. If you retired at 30, then you have lost 30 years if you are only then starting to think about the future.”', '“It was not a difficult decision (to retire). It was a good integration from active sports career to sports administration and a smooth transition.”', 'All that training of yore comes in useful for Bubka, in the city for the Tata Mumbai Marathon to be held on Sunday, as the event’s international ambassador vaults from one interview to the other, not always with delight. Dressed in the sponsor’s T-shirt, his slicked back hair mostly grey, the strength that lifted him to glory shows through those powerful forearms as he shakes hands firmly.', 'He is now also a successful businessman in Ukraine, with interests in a bakery, real estate and gas stations, started with the idea that he needed a job once he had hung up the pole.', '“It’s what I developed during my career and with my family afterwards,” says the 54-year-old. “It’s important we have some occupation and earnings for the future. It’s difficult to combine (sport and business) at the same time.', '“My friend in France showed me what he is doing in real life outside sport and they produce yeast. He asked if I would be able to sell in Ukraine. We tried, developed a distribution chain and then the bakery, the frozen dough, one factory, the second factory…', '“It’s not easy to manage,” mumbles Bubka, whose older son Vitaliy pursues a career in business and younger son Sergey Jr played professional tennis till recently.', 'Bubka’s total domination of his event for over a decade, from the time he won the world title in Helsinki in 1983 as an unknown 20-year-old till 1997 when he won the IAAF Grand Prix final in Fukuoka, is one of sport’s unique achievements. He first set a world record in 1984, cleared the then unattainable six metres in 1985 and kept going till he finished at 6.15m in 1993 (his 6.14m outdoor record came a year later).', '“Your opponents motivate you,” he says. “When someone breaks your record, you want it back.”', 'His unique technique—Bubka held the pole higher than most vaulters—combined with more speed on approach and flexibility of a gymnast gave him the necessary recoil force to go higher. He even used a heavier pole than most.', '“My technique is the work of my coach (Vitaly Petrov, who worked with Bubka all through his career) and my team. After I understood it and had some experience, we looked up other athletes, how they do it and used the best elements.', '“Technique has a significant contribution for everyone. It’s the reason why one is able to do it and the other is not. When you transfer (weight), you need to have good speed, for the transfer of energy from your body to the pole. With good technique, it gives you energy back. The pole has to bend when your legs are up and if you watch most pole-vaulters, the pole is already flat at this point. For that reason, the catapult energy is not transferred. That’s the key, the difference.', '“It’s running on the ground and gymnastics in the air,” summarises Bubka, who won the pole vault event in the IAAF World Athletics Championships six consecutive times from 1983 to 1997.', 'During his dominant years, when he was for all practical purposes competing only against himself, conspiracy theorists would claim that Bubka could have jumped far higher than he did. The only reason he held back, said these theorists, was to claim sponsor bonuses, which he would get for every record broken.', 'So he would add a new record slowly, going up centimetre by centimetre. For example, between 1991 and 1993, he beat his previous best 14 times. In fact, hazy old videos show Bubka clearing record heights with a comfortable margin in a sport where a hair’s width can send the bar crashing down.', '“Potentially, sure, could be possible (to have jumped higher), but what I achieved, this is reality,” says Bubka. “You can dream, you can try but sometimes, when I tried, I didn’t succeed. ‘Maybe’ does not count, only final results do.”', 'By the time he retired (in 2001), after the 2000 Sydney Olympics in which he failed to qualify for the final, the Ukranian was ready with his post-retirement plan—of giving back to the sport as an administrator.', '“I didn’t really announce (his retirement). I knew a long time ahead of the Olympics that this would be my last competition. I had plans for when I finished competition and continued to do what I wanted to,” says Bubka who became a member of the International Olympic Committee in 1999.', 'He does not believe his career would have taken a different path had he not lived through the Communist-Cold War era, at a time when, as a child, they had no facilities and played on the streets of Luhansk, his hometown.

You must be professional, do your work, focus on how you recover and what you do between training. I don’t think I would have been any different if I was participating now (post the Soviet Union). The principle of sport is the same, the values and preparation, training, key elements to success are the same.”', 'At his peak, he had to wait another four years for his only Olympic gold medal, in Seoul in 1988, with a jump of 5.9m. Winning just one Olympic medal can be termed as a blemish only in reference to Bubka’s sterling 18-year international career. His other Olympic attempts, in Barcelona in 1992, Atlanta 1996 and Sydney, were hampered by injuries and lack of form.', '“No one asked us (about the boycott),” Bubka said on Thursday at a press conference. “It was the decision of the leaders. When you go through so many years, it becomes more painful. I never had such tough competition as in 1988.”', '“I tried for a world record (in Seoul) but I had no energy left (after the gold medal-winning effort).

Writing is misunderstood. But writers write, consciously.While there is much that can be communicated by words, only a writer who has expended much time on the craft can tell a story. Photo: iStockphoto","['Nobody takes it for granted that they can get on a tabla and play it with the virtuosity of Zakir Hussain. For that matter, nobody claims they can stay on the crease as doggedly as Rahul Dravid can. Or drive an F1 car like Mika Hakkinen.', 'But to write is dreadfully easy, is a fondly held assumption. What muscle may it need, some ask, to write?', 'One narrative has it that writers offer opinions. And that to opine is easy. In any which case, everybody has an opinion on all narratives in the wind. If tutored in a language, some literature can be read on any theme and an opinion can be authored around why a narrative may be desirable or undesirable. The facts be damned.', 'Then there are writers of another kind. These are the ones who think all that is needed are reservoirs of imagination to draw from. Their output, when put to words, they claim, are works of fiction and poetry. Here again, popular narrative has it that to create works of such kinds, people sit someplace quiet and contemplate, until inspiration strikes. They then hammer away, in solitude, until they think it presentable.', '“Quaint” is a charitable word that comes to mind to describe these world views.', 'Some perspective is needed here. When that legendary physicist Richard Feynman pays an ode to a flower, why is it that he sees much beauty in it? So much so, that he can offer an opinion on why it matters to the biological ecosystem around it even as he thinks of it as a work of art. What gives him the mental muscle to be a physicist who can morph into a botanist to dissect a flower, an ecologist to survey the landscape, and an artist to appreciate the beauty in it?', 'Convention has it artists are the kinds who can see beauty intuitively and place a premium on it over others. But Feynman can see beauty in a flower because his mind can appreciate it from more perspectives than an artist, as convention defines these creatures, can ever imagine:', '“I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it’s not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimetre; there’s also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colours in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the colour. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower.”', 'Implicit to that assertion is that a scientist is an artist as well. If he can articulate it as clearly as that, he now morphs into a powerful story teller—or a writer in the purest sense—the kind of creature who can live in multiple worlds and embrace ambiguity.', 'The writer’s dilemma', 'While there is much that can be communicated by words, only a writer who has expended much time on the craft can tell a story. Because stories, much like Feynman’s metaphorical flower, must be examined.', 'Who may the various protagonists in it be? What may be the various motivations that drive them? Where may their allegiances lie? When did they make up their minds about where they are? Why do they stand where they are now?', 'Questions of these kinds are asked by people who probe, like detectives.', 'When questions such as these are asked, a writer finds himself staring at not one story—but multiple stories. How then is a writer to fuse it into a cohesive narrative that does justice to all the protagonists? People who attempt to synthesize narratives and comprehend the essence of what outcomes may emerge are leaders.', 'Because real stories come from real people. And when probed sincerely, people tell the truth. Any good writer knows everybody’s truth is a function of the world they reside in. But writers also know, that the world a person lives in has much to do with where their subject lives in. The world, writers also know, is not linear. But it resides on a continuum of time. The question writers then have to ask when listening to a story is, which part of time is the subject’s story emerging from? They may be telling the truth. But it is their truth. To look at it dispassionately then and holistically, a writer must step back and look at the subject in perspective, dispassionately, even as he offers a compassionate ear. How different may that be from a mental health professional?', 'What may have been true yesterday in City A and as witnessed by Person X may sound like a falsehood to Person Y in City B—both of whom may claim to be witnesses to the same event. The fact is, both are telling the truth, but offering different perspectives. How may a writer then weave through their stories to stitch a cohesive narrative and ensure it has beauty woven into it as well?', 'This is ambiguous territory because whose eyes is the truth to be looked at from? This is what those in science and religion have been at loggerheads at forever.', 'But all these are the domains a writer must navigate. There is much work that goes into it not evident to the uninitiated eye. That is why exasperation creeps in when I hear talk about how “content is now a commodity”.', 'Much of this has to do with the rise of the internet and an extremely popular story of how it has helped create a democracy in publishing. Apparently, this democracy ended a tin pot dictatorship run by publishers, writers and editors. In this lovely world, people can walk into public parks called the world wide web, create their own domains where they may park blogs or personal websites, and populate it with prose and poetry that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. If they may choose, there are social media platforms of all kinds to choose from as well.', 'There is much merit in this story. Because for too long, large parts of published content were controlled by a community that lived in gated communities. Their arrogance stays intact and they remain snooty. What hasn’t dawned upon them is that they now look like clowns posing as gatekeepers of all things libertarian.', 'But it is equally true that when walls of any kinds are broken down, democracies allow masses of mediocrity to come in as well. And the din created by the claps and coins mediocrity embraces, outshouts anything the polite interruptions that subtlety and nuance valiantly attempts.', 'To listen in to their voices takes much work and effort. But us humans are wired to be lazy. It is inevitable then that mediocrity rises to the top.', 'So, how is to one look for a good writer and skim past the mediocre?', 'Why writers ask', 'Before I delve further, two disclosures must be made:', '1.I gave up on God a long while ago.', '2.I did not choose the following passage. It chose me.', 'The passage appears inNight, a book by the Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel. He survived the Holocaust. It stuck as pertinent when thinking of what kind of questions make for good questions.', '“Blessed be God’s name? Why, but why would I bless Him? Every fibre in me rebelled. Because He caused thousands of children to burn in His mass graves? Because he kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, and so many other factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers, end up in the furnaces? Praised be Thy Holy Name, for having chosen us to be slaughtered on Thine altar?”', 'That passage doesn’t read like a question. It contains much anguish instead. But those familiar with Wiesel know he had a tortured soul. And that this passage emerged from his days after having witnessed the Holocaust as a young boy. It was a question he had grappled with in his head and is a theme he engaged with in much detail for all his life.', 'When looked at by the naïve, it is the kind of question anyone can ask. But when read closely, it is of the kind that can be asked only by somebody who may have seen horror first-hand.', 'Bluntly put, if I wore my editor’s hat, this is the kind of question that can emerge from a reporter who has done “been to the grass roots”. Because what is clear to a trained eye here is that when framed in this manner and articulated with as much passion, believers may be rattled.', 'Their responses it may evoke from them may be of two kinds.', 'The milder ones may respond with “The Lord behaves in mysterious ways”.', 'The aggressive will insist anyone who asks a question like this be gagged for questioning their God.', 'Non-believers like me will find their biases confirmed in this question.', 'But writers do not stop at having reported on the horrors they witnessed. They insist on exploring if other views may exist. Because they know multiple answers may emerge. Who is to know where the truth and their answer may lie? For them, the question marks the beginning of the journey to tell a story and it is too early to offer an opinion of any kind.', 'Writers choose to listen', 'Writing begins when you start to listen. Because the full story cannot be told or a firm opinion formed basis a single conversation. Because when multiple world views are sought, it challenges a writer to engage with worlds he had never imagined possible.', 'By way of example, in thinking of Richard Feynman, the easiest assumption to make of him as a scientist is that he places a premium on falsifiability over faith. I had imagined him in my mind as the kind who may suggest, I don’t believe in miracles and other such assorted phenomena.', 'But in listening to hisOde to a Flower, he asserts something else altogether I never thought could have emerged from him.', '“It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe beyond man, to think of what it means without man—as it was for the great part of its long history, and as it is in the great majority of places. When this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of matter are appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to see life as part of the universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an experience which is rarely described. It usually ends in laughter, delight in the futility of trying to understand. These scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged simply as a stage for God to watch man’s struggle for good and evil seems to be inadequate.”', 'This was a challenge to my belief that science must discard all faith in the idea of god to progress relentlessly. Because “God knows” is a thought-terminating, lazy and clichéd answer to all fundamental questions. If this be introduced, it can kill the scientific mind. How can the two possibly co-exist?', 'When probed some more and poring over the conversations of Krista Tippet in that marvelous book of hers that isEinstein’s God, one of the many pages in it include her interaction with the biologist Carl Freit. He describes his clinical pursuit of cancer as religious study of the Talmud as “dual intellectual quests”.', 'Science asks penetrating questions of “how”, he explains, yet, “the physical universe doesn’t come beset with values…. From the scientific perspective, everything that we can discover we should discover. The problem comes up once you’ve discovered it.”', 'To place that into perspective, he offers the dilemma researchers were confronted with when exploring the potential energy of an atom. The original intent was to exploit the energy embedded in it. On the other hand, it can also be used to create a bomb that can annihilate humanity even as cure’s cancer. What ought atomic energy be looked at from then?', 'Between Feynman’s assertion on appreciating awe and the dichotomy Freit present’s, a writer now stumbles upon that the answer to Weisel’s anguished question is not a simple one. What intersections may it lie at? Is it possible no answers exist? Does the joy in writing lie in the quest for answers?', 'Writers live alone', 'There are no answers to questions like these. It is a dilemma every writer must wrestle with. Must the story be given up on? Ought it be told as it is now and left for the reader to imagine what the outcomes maybe? Or is this the time to offer an opinion?', 'There is a dilemma Freit the scientist has grappled with as well, and shared with Tibbet.', '“The typical human problem, and one whose answer religion aims to supply, is always of the following form: Should I do this? Should we do this? Should the government do this? To answer these questions we can resolve it into two parts: First — If I do this, what will happen? — and second — Do I want that to happen? What would come of it of value — of good?”', 'In attempting to resolve this question, he broke it down into two parts.', 'a) Should I do this? Should we do it? Should the government do this?', 'That is a scientific question. Because you won’t know until you try. And science insists you try. Who knows what outcomes may emerge out of it?', 'b) But once I know what will come of it, how may I, or we or the government use it?', 'That is not for science to answer. It is a moral question and requires much deliberation. Who is to decide what is right for whom and in what context? Is there some divine intervention that can be called in for here?', 'These are questions to which there are no answers. Whatever emerges can challenge both the believer and the non-believer.', 'It is inevitable then that a writer retreat into loneliness. Because all of what has listened in to, must be absorbed. Some sense of it must be made so a story can be told. How is he to answer know after all his investigations if god exists or not?', 'Embedded in Weisel’s question is an insinuation if there is a god, it must be an evil creature and must be revolted against. But if that be taken at face value, and as articulated by Feynman, perils exist that we may miss what may be magnificent. But the magnificence in it must be given much thought as well cautions Freid, because of the dichotomies in the answers caution Freit.', 'To offer an opinion now, a writer must go through gut-wrenching loneliness. This is a story that goes untold.', 'Writers never stop', 'When loneliness of this kind stares at a writer, it can be terrifying to take an informed position. One choice they have is to abandon the mental ask that it takes to form an opinion and stick to telling the narrative as it is. Or they can continue to search. Who is to know where a pointer may lie?', 'It is entirely possible that it may lie in the soul of the subject who asked the question. When Wiesel is read closer, he offers what lenses does he look at god from.', 'When he was as anguished as he was, he turned to the scriptures. ironically, it led him to Moses, the ancestor of his forefathers as described in the scriptures his forefathers had handed him. On close scrutiny, it turns out, Moses had felt the same loneliness that Wiesel had at one point. It compelled him to study Moses in much detail and answers on leadership started to emerge for Wiesel.', '“Naturally, a true leader cannot function without those whom he or she leads. By the same token, the leader cannot work or live in their midst as one of them. Hence the ambivalence of his or her position. There must be some distance between the leader and those being led; otherwise the leader will be neither respected nor obeyed. A certain mystique must surround the leader, isolating him or her from those whose servant he or she is called upon to be or has been elected to be. Is there a leader, here or anywhere, who does not find time to complain about the terrible solitude at moments of decision?”', 'And so, Weisel concluded:', '“Here is Moses’s singularity. A man of the situation, he was always there when needed, and then he gave himself completely to his task. He had no ambition to become a prophet, but once he became one, he was the greatest. He did not seek the role of political or military leader, but once he took it on, he was the best. Philosophers would say that if a human being is what he or she becomes, Moses was a human being par excellence.”', 'It was some of the finest lessons on life and living a tortured soul could get. The outcomes of which were books and a life dedicated to the pursuit of philosophy.', 'Writers, then write', 'After all of this is done, a writer gets down to write. Consider this passage that follows that was created by Gary Provost.', '“This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals—sounds that say listen to this, it is important.”', 'Why is work of this kind different from the music that emerges out of Zakir Hussain’s tabla or the flourish with which Rahul Dravid crafts a century?']"

Otherwise, you will waste your life like I did.""', ""I thought of Professor H and other nameless tragics of the ilk as I read Sanjay Manjrekar's arresting autobiography,Imperfect.

Obsession may not be enough to overcome a technical deficiency (as with Manjrekar's own batting), and there are all those days when one wonders what might have been."", 'From early on, Manjrekar\'s burden was one of legacy. His father Vijay, a towering figure in Mumbai\'s cricketing circles, had played 53 tests for India. He was also a ""troubled soul post retirement"", ill-tempered and struggling ""to find his place in the world after his playing days"". It is probably why Sanjay was so determined to build a second career following his own retirement—in the manner of the child of an alcoholic parent resolving to be a teetotaler.', 'Manjrekar insists that he was ""not really that into sport"" and would even now rather watch a film or listen to music than pick up a bat for a backyard game. Finding cricket to be a ""convenient career path"" and wanting to be famous like his father, he set out for the ordained destination from the maidans of Mumbai. Being Vijay\'s son, he found many doors open for him and he has written feelingly about the Mumbai cricketing fraternity taking on the guardian role after his father\'s death.', 'As with many of us, his college days were the real ""wonder years"". Memories of his six hundreds in an inter-university tournament in Baroda are recollected in the same breath as those of watching English films on the VCR with his friends. On the back of those Baroda hundreds, he was called up to the formidable Mumbai Ranji squad—famed for its ‘khadoos’ brand of cricket—and it was not long before he made the Test team.', ""In Barbados, on his first overseas tour and in only his third Test, he scored a hundred against a fearsome attack. Yet, in the chapter about the tour to the Caribbean, he does not dwell too much on his exploits on the pitch. Instead, he shares delightful anecdotes highlighting the cricketing culture of the West Indies: chatty, knowledgeable locals; the graciousness shown by players like Desmond Haynes and Jeff Dujon; the spirit of fair play that King Richards lived by. This chapter is my personal favourite: it confirms all that is great and good about Caribbean cricket, and justifies all those laments about its decline from tragics of my father's vintage."", ""The chapter titled ‘Pakistan’ may well have been called ‘Imran Khan Niazi’, for Manjrekar devotes almost all of it to the Pakistani legend. Professor H will be pleased. In lesser sports autobiographies and fan writing, it is not unknown for admiration to slip into a cloying fawning but Manjrekar's narrative manages to balance an almost child-like fascination with a mature, measured respect grounded in personal experience and interactions."", 'The book has been marketed as ""Manjrekar the analyst on Manjrekar the cricketer and person"".

Nowhere is this more evident than in the successive chapters dealing with his struggles and consequent early retirement at the age of 32.', '', 'The slide began during the gruelling tour to Australia in the run-up to the 1992 World Cup. Trouble with running between the wickets exposed his lack of fitness on the ""big and soft outfields"". The obsession with technique began to take over, but no amount of tinkering could conclusively resolve his problems with the short ball, especially on overseas pitches. Memorably, he likens the efforts to correct his issues in the nets to preventing leaks in a boat with holes: every time a hole is plugged, water would enter through another.', 'Manjrekar does not shy from sharing home truths about the men who played for the country in the last days of amateurism and the first ones of private television channels—the late 80s and early 90s. Then, the dressing room was a distrustful place, with ""everyone living in their own bubble"" and ""looking after their own interests"". There was a clear divide between players from the North Zone and the West Zone, and superstar batsmen frequently demoted themselves down the order when the West Indian bowlers came to town.', ""Balanced assessments about players like Kapil Dev (sweet and amiable now but helplessly caught up in his superstardom then), Mohammed Azharuddin (average tactician but very honest and quietly generous) and Manoj Prabhakar (untrustworthy but a fearless fighter) seem unforced and reveal that Manjrekar's analytical mind was always at work, on and off the field."", 'By his own admission, Manjrekar\'s transition into commentary was ""seamless"". Justifiably, he takes pride in being able to conduct live shows, engaging viewers even as he is plugged-in to the production room chaos on his earpiece. There are many insights into what goes on behind the scenes in a cricket production, including some background to the incident where Dean Jones was heard referring to Hashim Amla as ""a terrorist"" on air.', 'Manjrekar is a man of strong opinions, and I have often heard him being challenged by his colleagues in the commentary box. He is also trolled a fair bit for his opinions on social media. Whatever the eventual merit of his views, he does comes across as a thinking man who likes to do his homework.', 'The book conveys his appreciation of the value that such discussions add to the viewing experience. Here is a former Test cricketer who is open to learning from even his much younger colleagues—he has high praise for 27-year-old anchor Raunak Kapoor—and is actively calling for more non-cricketers to be part of commentary teams.', 'There is a lot inImperfectfor the tragics but the money section might well be the few pages that follow Manjrekar asking us: “What is batting, really? Is it scoring runs or scoring runs the right way? What is the right way? Who decides the right way?”', 'In the hours that we tragics have spent dissecting the style versus effectiveness question (and watching every ball of a Test series), some of us could have learnt to speak Spanish or master the violin. Manjrekar confesses that he could not help wanting to defend correctly all the time, and look good while doing it. Why are we artless commoners so emotionally invested in this game? The answer is in a Marathi saying Manjrekar uses to explain his obsession with technique: ""Swabhavala aushad nahi"". There is no medicine to remedy one\'s nature.']"

Rajasthan’s home and justice minister Gulabchand Kataria said the state government has decided to file a review petition in the Supreme court. The review petition would be filed on Monday or Tuesday, he said.', 'Kataria also asked the Karni Sena, a group protesting against the film, to be a party to the petition. “After studying the Supreme Court’s decision against the ban on the film, the state government has decided to file a review petition in the Supreme court. The state government is of the view that the honour of the historic event of ‘Jauhar’ should be protected as per the public sentiment,” he told reporters after a meeting with Karni Sena leaders.', 'Along with the Karni sena, the erstwhile royal family of Mewar is also likely to be a party in the petition, he said. Rajput outfits, especially Karni Sena, have accused Sanjay Leela Bhansali of presenting distorted facts regarding Rani Padmavati in the film. The film production company has rejected the allegations.', 'Karni Sena on Saturday also claimed that Bhansali Productions had sent a letter inviting them to watch the film. Chief patron of Shree Rajput Karni Sena Lokendra Singh Kalvi, however, termed it a drama and said the letter will be burnt and no reply given. “This letter is nothing but a drama by the film maker. There is no date of the proposed screening the film and they have termed our objection as ‘misguided grievances’ which shows their approach and intention,” Kalvi told reporters.', 'Kalvi said that the Supreme Court had ruled against a ban on the film but now a ‘Janta curfew’ would be imposed to prevent its release. “As a mark of respect to the Republic Day on 26 January, we are not calling for a bandh, now we are calling for a Janta curfew,” he said. He said that the historians who were shown the film by the censor board were also of the opinion that the film should not be released.', 'After Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the Karni Sena has also targeted censor board chief Prasoon Joshi saying he should not enter Rajasthan. “If he comes here, he should come on his own responsibility,” Karni Sena leader Mahipal Singh said. Joshi is scheduled to attend a session ‘Main aur Who: Conversation with Myself’ on 28 January, on the fourth day of the five-day literature festival beginning in Jaipur on 25 January.', 'Meanwhile, some film distributors have expressed unwillingness in purchasing the distribution rights of the film in the state. “I am not going to purchase the rights of the film as I am going out of the country on a family holiday on 24th January,” a leading film distributor, Raj Bansal, toldPTI. He said that the decision to purchase the rights could have been taken after the Supreme Court’s order but sentiments of Rajasthan are associated with the film so he preferred to go out on holiday rather than purchasing the rights.', '“If the distributors are not ready to purchase the rights, the film producer approaches the exhibitors (cinema halls) for exhibiting the film but confusion is prevailing in case ofPadmaavat,” Govind Khandelwal, manger of Entertainment Paradise said. He said that there were queries from audiences but since no decision had been taken, no booking has taken place.', 'The manager of Raj Mandir cinema, Ashok Tanwar, said that when distributors were not purchasing the rights, there was no question of releasing the film. “We are not expecting the film’s release and this is what we are telling those who are making queries about the film’s release,” he said.

They have a lot to tell and prove that there was no office of profit case. It is unconstitutional and illegal,” Sisodia said.', '“We are seeking appointment to meet the president and the MLAs will convey him that it is a biased recommendation and against natural justice,” he said.', 'On Friday, the Election Commission (EC) asked the President to disqualify the 20 MLAs for holding offices of profit, setting the stage for their ouster from the assembly. In its opinion sent to President Kovind, the EC said the MLAs, by occupying the post of parliamentary secretaries between 13 March 2015 and 8 September 2016, held offices of profit, and were liable to be disqualified as legislators, highly-placed sources have said.', 'The development does not threaten the AAP government in Delhi as it has 66 MLAs in the 70-member assembly. Still, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have demanded Kejriwal’s resignation on moral grounds. Sisodia said the AAP will also go to court on the matter. “We hope to get justice in court and the case will not stand. Even if justice was denied us in the court, we will go to the people’s court which is the biggest court,” he said.', 'He also hit out at the BJP, saying it wants elections so that all schemes and projects initiated by the AAP government can be derailed. “They have been trying hard, but none of their conspiracies succeeded. BJP people are having problem because of successes of the AAP government in three years. Now, we are going to do door-step delivery of services, new Mohalla clinics are coming up, CCTV project is in final stage. The government is now in fourth gear and the BJP is trying to stop us from working on these projects,” he said.', 'Sarita Singh, AAP MLA from Rohtas Nagar, echoed Sisodia’s views. She said the parliamentary secretaries did not get any pecuniary benefit. On the contrary, the parliamentary secretaries had to spend money from their pockets, Singh said. Alka Lamba, AAP MLA from Chandani Chowk, said all 20 AAP MLAs have sought appointment with the president at individual level. “Plus, a petition is also being drafted for all 20 MLAs,” Lamba said.']"

He said in separate tweets that Democrats “could easily have made a deal” to avoid the shutdown but were “holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen!”', 'The White House believes a catchy nickname—the “Schumer Shutdown”—and the fact a majority of Democrats in the Senate voted to block a stopgap spending bill will rally public opinion to Trump’s side. But early polling shows that a plurality of voters are inclined to hold the president and congressional Republicans responsible, not the Democratic minority in the Senate led by New York’s Chuck Schumer.', 'Trump was defiant, however, vowing not to negotiate immigration changes Democrats desire until the government reopens—while characteristically insulting his opponents.', '‘Obstructionist losers’', '“This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement shortly before the shutdown began. “We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands.”', 'With the government shut, Trump postponed plans to spend the weekend at his Florida club. An anniversary party had been planned at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach Saturday night with tickets going for at least $100,000 a couple—a price-tag that would include a photo with the president as well as dinner.', 'One thing that could spare Trump any lasting damage: if the shutdown remains brief. Congress may vote as early as this weekend to reopen the government for at least a few weeks.', 'An extended shutdown would blunt the momentum from a tax overhaul bill that was the top achievement of his first year in office—something Trump has emphasized in his Twitter messages. It also could muddy the message of his first State of the Union address on 29 January if the White House remains mired in budget negotiations.', 'Plays well with base', 'Trump’s refusal to concede to Democratic demands that Congress rapidly enact protections for so-called Dreamers—immigrants brought illegally to the country as children—may play well with his base. But Trump’s standing with his base seems rock-solid. It’s the middle-of-the-road voters who doubt his capabilities as a leader, and shutting down the government controlled entirely by his own party will likely rekindle those questions.', 'Schumer said the shutdown was due to an absence of leadership by Trump. In negotiations on Friday at the White House, the Democrat said, he had “reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussions,” referring to the wall on the US border with Mexico that was the centrepiece of Trump’s campaign.', '“In the room, it sounded like the president was open to accepting it,” Schumer said. But afterward, he said, Trump didn’t press Republican leaders in Congress to take the deal.', 'Chaos unleashed', 'When his fellow Republicans looked to him for guidance, “the president provided none,” Schumer said.', '“Unfortunately, a Trump shutdown would be a perfect encapsulation of the chaos he’s unleashed on our government,” Schumer said. “Instead of bringing us all together he’s pulled us apart. Instead of governing from the middle he’s outsourced his presidency to the extremes.”', 'Democrats could share blame for the shutdown if voters conclude that the plight of the immigrants—who aren’t under imminent threat of deportation—isn’t worth the fight. ACNNpoll released Friday showed 56% of Americans believe it’s more important to keep the government open than to preserve protections for the immigrants that Trump announced he’d end in September.', '“Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy,” Trump said in a Twitter post late Friday night.', 'Hashtag wars', 'The White House and Republicans also pushed the alliterative hashtag on Twitter, #SchumerShutdown, but other shutdown-related hashtags were more popular in the early-morning hours, led by #TrumpShutdown.', 'The same CNN poll found that 47% of Americans would blame Trump or congressional Republicans for the shutdown. An ABC News/Washington Post poll published earlier on Friday found a similar result, with 48% blaming Trump and his party versus 28% faulting Democrats.', 'The symbolism is particularly rich for Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to shake up a capital that he said had lost its way. He was in a unique position to make changes, with his Republican party controlling all of Washington for the first time in more than a decade.', 'Yet the shutdown is very much the product of the president’s own penchant for chaos. It was essentially cemented a week ago, after Trump blew up a potential bipartisan deal on immigration during a meeting at the White House, denigrating Haitian and African immigrants in the process and deepening mistrust among Democrats.', 'But that was only the most recent—and the most damaging—of the president’s actions. In December, Schumer and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi cancelled a planned meeting at the White House to discuss the spending impasse after Trump insulted them on Twitter. On Thursday, he announced on Twitter that he didn’t want children’s health insurance renewed as part of a short-term spending bill—a provision House Republicans had added to the legislation specifically to entice Democrats to vote for it.', 'The White House walked back that tweet later in the day, saying Trump would in fact support the bill.', 'The drama may simply feed public disgust with Washington—the so-called “swamp” that Trump has decidedly failed to drain.', 'The ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 18% blame both sides in equal measure. The poll was conducted Monday through Thursday, before House Republicans passed stopgap legislation that would fund the government for another 30 days. GOP leaders hope that will help them deflect some of the blame onto the opposition party.', 'Blame game', 'But Schumer’s caucus are not the only lawmakers in the Senate who refused to go along with the House Republicans’ plan. Republican senators Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul, Jeff Flake and Mike Lee all voted against a procedural manoeuvre to consider the House bill, and John McCain is home in Arizona battling cancer.', 'Even some conservative House Republicans expressed doubt that their party would be able to pin blame for a shutdown on Democrats.', '“It’s hard to do that, when as I understand it, there are three Republicans voting no in the Senate,” said Representative Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, hours before the Senate vote.', 'Furloughing federal workers would only contribute to the sense that Trump is unable or unwilling to govern—a notion that his critics say was underscored by the president’s rash tweeting and his rejection of the bipartisan immigration deal. In an acknowledgment of the image problem, the White House said parks and monuments would stay open, at least for some time, during the shutdown.', 'Risking growth?', 'Moreover, the economic impact of an extended shutdown could dampen the booming economy that’s provided one of the few bright spots for Republicans during Trump’s tumultuous first year. A shutdown that lasts a week and puts 850,000 federal workers on furlough would reduce US economic growth in the quarter by around 0.1 percentage point, according to Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics.', 'The stakes, for both sides, include the outcome of November’s midterm elections—and, in turn, the success of the Trump presidency.', 'White House officials argued that Democrats have supported short-term funding bills like the House legislation in the past. Schumer and his colleagues are “hellbent on a shutdown,” legislative director Marc Short said earlier in the day on Friday.', 'But such arguments were deployed in the last shutdown—and Democrats aren’t persuaded they result in political punishment.', '2013 shutdown', 'In 2013, congressional Republicans forced a government shutdown in a bid to defund the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. While former President Barack Obama railed against the impact on federal workers, Republicans went on to flip nine Senate seats and 13 House seats in the subsequent midterm elections.', 'Democrats argue that the issue of blame is more muddled this time. With Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell unable to deliver all of his caucus’s votes for a spending bill, Democrats believe they can frame Republican leaders as offering an unreasonable strategy even their own members can’t support.', 'It’s a gamble. The moment requires Democrats to essentially choose between two pillars of their political brand: protecting immigrants illegally brought to the US as children, and the broader notion they are the responsible stewards of the federal government, willing to prioritize basic economic and political stability.', 'Senate Republican leaders say they’re determined to force the opposition party to vote repeatedly against reopening the government, knowing that each high-profile session could spook Democrats facing tough re-election fights this year.', 'Five Democrats—Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and newly-elected Doug Jones of Alabama—broke ranks and supported the Republican stopgap measure in Friday’s procedural vote.Bloomberg']"

Upon finding it he showed it to the strangers in the room and said that he is proud to be a Hindu. He said he is a “Hindu guy, Hindutva guy”. And he said, “This is a Hindu country.” In the authors’ lounge atThe Hindu’s literature festival last week, he was having an informal conversation after learning the topic of an impending panel discussion—“Why is India’s secular nationalism under attack?”. “This is Hindustan,” he said, “This is Hindustan. We are only letting Muslims and Christians live with us.”', 'I was surprised but the reason is not what you probably have in mind. I have never heard a Tamilian say “Hindustan” before. The rest of what he said did not bother me. My first two decades were in Chennai and I am accustomed to people speaking their minds and when they are at it, pulling theirpoonal(sacred thread) out, and even groping for it first. Usually they say things with no malice.', 'It was inevitable that something about science will follow. “I can scientifically prove in 15 minutes that India is a Hindu country,” he said.', '“All right,” I said.', '“I can prove it in 5 minutes actually,” he said, gathering his thoughts. Then he said, “Or at least you will not be able to scientifically disprove it.” The scientific proof never came.', 'I was home. My childhood was filled  with such moments. Even nationalism never seemed morbid when you heard it in Chennai. It is more comic lament than threat. And I love how even in its most stupid moments the city will invoke science. It is never some sacred book, or a quote, in Chennai it is usually science. “I will scientifically prove that…” There is a long list of things that can fill the blanks, and they are a parallel emotional history of the great loveable city.', 'Do we love only what is good and what is excellent? When we are asked why we love what we love we search for great reasons. Maybe that is not necessary. When I left Madras (now Chennai) in 1995, through its giant railway station, I was fleeing a dirty parched chaotic corrupt ugly nepotistic city for better prospects and hopefully sexual decadence, and since then refused to accept that I had any love for a mere place just because I spent the first 20 years of my life there. People who spoke with great affection about their unremarkable hometowns, I thought, were only exhibiting the delirium of narcissism. But I am now developing an affection for Chennai as the allure of homelessness is fading. What is so wrong to belong to a place? I always thought something was wrong with that sort of thinking. I thought we can never be free if we belong. But that is a tiring sort of existence.', 'The modern urban Indian is a cultural orphan, as a result he keeps finding false homes. In ideologies, faiths, moral convictions and cosy clubs and foreign cultures that do not care about him. Maybe we should just fall towards our real homes, the places that raised us. What the hometown has is time, our epic early histories. We love nothing more than ourselves and what we see in the hometown is ourselves.', 'People tell me that Chennai has changed a lot since the time I left it but I see mostly the same city. Men do not bounce on their dowry scooters to kick-start them, but I can still steal from my novel that was set in the Madras of the 1990s to describe the Chennai of today. In the mornings, in the TamBrahm colony where I grew up, as in many other lanes, there is still the fragrance of the same paradisiacal breakfasts, and the chant of Carnatic singer M.S. Subbulakshmi from a thousand devices. Cycling to some tutorial is still the same type of a young man—antiquated, a thick steel watch on the wrist, oiled hair combed in the good-boy hairstyle, and looking like the past of an old man.', 'Actor Rajinikanth has been gentrified, which is where his cinematic destruction lies, but he is still a public mascot of the city. The hoarding painters still paint his face pink instead of black. Hysteria is still a dialect of Tamil.', 'The Chennai of my time is in turn an ancient way of the world. My new affection for my roots is, apart from narcissism, a result of a fatigue with a kind of modernity that requires you to be homeless. When you are homeless you are perpetually in the sway of dominant cultures, and I am sick of both the north Indian and Western ways. To be modern now is, at times, beginning to feel clownish. Also, the idea of “global” is clearly more farcical than liberal. “Global” is a quality that exists only in relation to the West; “global” is what white people call that part of human culture that is distant and exotic but still comprehensible to them. This we know from “global literature”, “global cinema”, “global food” and other such inanities.', 'We do not know what we are when we are global, we have a better grasp over ourselves when we see ourselves at home, as creations of what our hometowns taught us to love and hate, accept and reject. What may have Madras taught me? That melodrama is not a form of mediocrity. That an actor knows acting only if he can cry and laugh at the same time, everyone else is just making faces. That ultimately how you fight colonizers is not flinging grenades at them but by persisting with your traditions and tiring them out. That we should be secretive about important things. That at any given moment in the world, someone is a Brahmin, someone is not, and what the Brahmin loves is always called culture, and what the others love is called folk.', 'I had once renounced the idea of home because I thought I had no use of it.

What explains the novel’s persistence in pop culture and why is it worth revisiting after two centuries?","['Most readers with a passing interest in the classics would have heard of the story of the 18-year-old Mary Godwin conceiving of a fantastical tale that bestowed literary immortality on her on a stormy night in June 1816. She and her soon-to-be husband Percy Bysshe Shelley were guests of Lord Byron’s at the Villa Diodati in the village of Cologny, near Lake Geneva, in Switzerland.Frankenstein, the novel she wrote inspired by a frivolous dare among friends, turns 200 this year.', 'Apart from spawning a rich tradition of science fiction and horror in literature, cinema and the visual arts, the iconic gothic novel has added the word “Frankenstein” to the English vocabulary—borrowed from the name of the hapless scientist who raises a “monster” from the dead, bringing disastrous consequences upon himself. The Oxford English Dictionary classifies it as noun: Frankenstein is “a thing that becomes terrifying or destructive to its maker”. In its contemporary usage, though, the word has far exceeded its specific connotation, becoming synonymous, albeit misleadingly, with a range of other references—a creature of pure evil, a signifier of hubris, the devil incarnate, a baleful, destructive force.', 'If the term conjures up a vision of the living dead, most commonly represented by a zombie with putrefying flesh and repulsive face, that is the effect Shelley (she was married to the poet by the time Frankenstein was first published in 1818) had possibly intended for the reader. The idea to entertain themselves with self-composed horror stories had struck the assorted company at Villa Diodati—the Shelleys, Lord Byron and his friend, John William Polidori—as a sport and pastime. But what began as fun and games resulted in a prose fragment by Byron, which appeared as part of a long narrative poem,Mazeppa, in 1819. Polidori wrote TheVampyre, also published in 1819, which heralded an immensely popular supernatural genre that reached its epitome with Bram Stoker’sDracula(1897) and persists well into the 21st century in franchises likeTwilight. Shelley’s masterpiece had a stranger gestation, progressing through multiple editions to reach its present avatar, which was substantially edited by her husband, but was published in its current form in 1831, long after his death.', 'In spite of its spooky provenance,Frankensteinhas been called the mother of the modern science fiction fantasy by Brian W. Aldiss, one of the genre’s most celebrated practitioners, and with good reason. Born to Mary Wollstonecraft, the feminist writer who died giving birth to her, and William Godwin, a liberal political thinker, Mary Shelley grew up in an ambience of free thought. At 16, she fell for Percy Bysshe Shelley, while he was still married to his first wife Harriet and had had the distinction of being expelled from Oxford for propagating atheism. The two eloped shortly afterward, lived a peripatetic life, enjoying the company of fellow Romantics, and soaked in the spirit of scientific rationalism that had flourished with the Enlightenment in the 18th century.', 'Although Shelley didn’t go deep into the mechanics of resurrecting the dead inFrankenstein, she quoted the authority of the renowned physician, Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin, in the opening passage of the preface, to emphasize the credibility of her plot. The central moment in the narrative—that of the animation of the dead by Victor Frankenstein—is “not of impossible occurrence”, she wrote, attributing this view to the revered scientist. Lest her claim might be deemed heretical, she balanced this proposition by drawing generously from the creation myth described by John Milton inParadise Lost, which gave credence to the Biblical narrative of Adam and Eve, but also tempered it by mentioning the theories of Italian polymath Galileo Galilei.', 'From the epigraphs to each of the three volumes ofFrankensteinto sporadic references to Adam and Satan along the way, the influence ofParadise Lostis all-pervasive in Shelley’s novel, as it was on the work of most other Romantics. Yet, while drawing on literary history, she was keenly aware of the advances made in the sciences during her time. By the timeFrankensteinwas written, Newton’s laws of nature, gravity and his theory of the universe were over a century old, Kepler’s laws were still being debated and Michael Faraday was making headway into the discovery of the properties of electromagnetism and electricity (it’s not a coincidence that Frankenstein is fascinated by the power of the latter to inject life into dead flesh and bones). But Shelley’s scientific temper and taste for the macabre were also inflected by a more personal, indeed primal, impulse.', '', 'One of the most moving readings ofFrankensteincan be found in a chapter titled “Ice” in Rebecca Solnit’s autobiographical book of essays,The Faraway Nearby. A year before she began the novel, Solnit writes, Shelley, then barely 17, lost a baby girl, born prematurely, who lived for two weeks and faded away quietly in her sleep.', '“My dearest Hogg my baby is dead,” she wrote to her friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg, evidently distraught but still capable of going over her loss in excruciating detail. “It was perfectly well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.”', 'Days later, she noted in her journal a haunting dream. “Dream that my little baby came to life again—that it had only been cold & that we rubbed it before the fire & it lived. Awoke and found no baby. I think about the little thing all day.” There’s a record of a similar dream again sometime later—only Shelley knew how many more such visitations she might have had.', 'In the next few years, Shelley would give birth to three more children, only one of whom would live, and nearly die of miscarriage herself, narrowly escaping the fate of her own mother who had died shortly after she was born. Saved by the quick thinking of her husband, Shelley would lose him too, as he drowned after his sailboat was hit by a tempest.', 'Wedged into this series of births and deaths in Shelley’s life, the appeal ofFrankensteingoes far beyond its promise of terror and titillation, crossing over into the realm of plaintive tragedy. At its heart, there is a yearning for the dead to come back to life, a cry every individual who has ever lost a loved one will recognize. But the fulfilment of that impossible wish, even within the make-believe world of fiction, exacts a devastating price.', 'Having suffered several agonizing losses by the time she was 25, Shelley knew no other way to end her story but to let her “monster”, once lovingly called back to live among humans, disappear into a vast expanse of unending ice.', 'Also Read:', 'The postmodern Prometheus', 'Frankenstein at the movies: Bad parents, problem children', 'Music of the monster', 'The anatomy of Frankenstein book covers']"

Misunderstood, maligned and unloved by his “father”, his story is as tragic as it is filled with terror and it is one that has fascinated a range of musicians from the late Jerry Garcia to Metallica and Alice Cooper.', 'Metal, rock and punk bands obsessed over Frankenstein’s monster and his splintered soul. He embodied the dualities of life and death, darkness and suffering. Right from his inception in Mary Shelley’s gothic masterpiece to his onscreen rendition in films, he was a creature born to be part of rock iconography.', 'In a 1995 interview for the AMC showThe Movie That Changed My Life, Garcia recounted how his mother had taken him to seeAbbott And Costello Meet Frankensteinin 1948 when he was just six years old. He said, “I had never seen a horror movie before and it frightened me and I mostly hid behind the seats. It was sheer panic.” The movie affected him more deeply because he watched it a few months after his father had died. And the idea of a dead thing brought to life as a monster was like a bogeyman for him.', 'Later, he watched the film many times and mentioned how Frankenstein’s monster evoked something deep in him and became a personal icon of sorts. Garcia mentions studying the make-up done by the legendary Jack Pierce for the 1931 film and drawing pictures of Frankenstein’s monster over and over in different configurations. And it is fitting that film-maker Amir Bar-Lev’s excellent six-part documentary on The Grateful Dead,Long Strange Trip, which released on Amazon Prime last year, was interspersed with images of Frankenstein’s monster. It was a creature that became a metaphor for how Garcia viewed art, music and even life and death. Similarly, in Metallica’sSome Kind Of Monster,the band refers to a creature akin to Frankenstein’s invention which becomes a  larger metaphor on life and  their trajectory as artists.', 'Other musicians have rendered the creature as a sentient being in their songs, with psychological complexity and as a composite of his traumas, guilt and cruel rejections. New York Dolls, in their 1973 songFrankenstein, used the tormented creature as an analogy for teenage angst and alienation. This trope persisted in Alice Cooper’sTeenage Frankensteinfrom his 1986 albumConstrictor. With lines like,I’m a teenage Frankenstein/The local freak with the twisted mind...Got a synthetic face/Got some scars and a brace/ My hands are rough and bloody/I walk into the night/Women faint at the sight/I ain’t no cutie-pie, it seemed as if Frankenstein was indeed the greatest metaphor ever created for a generation of troubled youth.', '', 'Rammstein’s despondent trackMutterpsychoanalyses the scars left by bad parenting and tells the story of a child much like Frankenstein’s monster born of an experiment and consequently bereft of parental love. He is finally driven to kill himself and his “mother” but survives even though he is permanently disfigured. The soul-searing refrain addressed to the dead mother towards the end of the song is filled with the same anguish that the monster feels when Frankenstein dies.', 'American hard rockers Blue Öyster Cult’s inThe Siege And Investiture Of Baron Von Frankenstein’s Castle At Weisseriamove away from the monster to take a look at his maker, Frankenstein. This song is part of the band’s epic rock operaImaginos, where the doctor is cast as an agent of evil who sends out his terrible inventions into the world.', 'Yet there are instances when he is also a creature of whimsy and humour who can pull off a song and dance routine with aplomb. In Mel Brooks’Young Frankenstein,young Frederick, Victor Frankenstein’s grandson (played by Gene Wilder), and Peter Boyle as his newly reanimated monster, put up a fantastic performance parodying Fred Astaire’sPuttin’ On The Ritz. One of the funniest lines in the same film is delivered by Dr Frankenstein’s dim-witted assistant Igor who ushers his new master to his room, repeating the refrain, “Walk this way”. Effortlessly funny, this was the line that prompted Aerosmith to name their 1977 song after it. In 1986, RUN-D.M.C.’s rap-rock mashup ofWalk This Waygave it a new popularity as it climbed to No.4 on the Billboard charts that year.', 'In Mary Shelley’s novel, the monster escapes Frankenstein’s laboratory and arrives at a blind man’s cottage where he hears him playing an instrument. He describes his untutored response as a “mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food....” This is among the book’s most poignant moments where, although monstrous in form, the creature instinctively reacts to the sweetness of the sound and its underlying “mournful air” like little children often do. And it seems quite apt that it is through music again that the monster is given a second life and rendered human.']"

Reanimated corpses, hubristic scientists, secret laboratories, rogue humanoid creations—each of these tropes scream “pulp”! Throw in Shelley’s geographic plot devices, like a ship stuck in the Arctic ice or a hidden retreat in a remote Scottish island, and the pulpy potential of the story becomes more marked.', 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, pulp writers pounced upon the twin tropes of mad scientist and reanimation first. It certainly inspired pulp’s greatest luminary, H.P. Lovecraft. One of his early tales,Herbert West—Reanimator,is a take onFrankensteinthat transforms the philosophical and moral horror at the heart of Shelley’s novel into something out ofTales From The Crypt. Serialized in an amateur magazine calledHome Brewbetween February and July 1922, Lovecraft wrote his story for the most pulp of reasons—he needed the money. Not that he was too happy with the $5 (around Rs300 now) that he was paid for his troubles.', 'While Shelley’s novel and Lovecraft’s story are similar in their basic premise, they vary wildly when it comes to looking at the consequences of trying to play god. Both Victor Frankenstein and Herbert West start out as idealistic geniuses at odds with scientific dogma. However, while Frankenstein never recreates his experiment, destroying his creation’s proposed bride before giving her life, West keeps on with increasing zeal. This eventually leads to insanity. Narrated by West’s friend in the aftermath of the former’s mysterious and, as the reader learns, ghoulish disappearance, we get a yarn that spans 17 years. It begins as West and the narrator are finishing medical school at Miskatonic University in Arkham, Lovecraft’s imagined locale of choice. West clashes with his professors, who frown upon his experimental re-vivification “solutions”, even as he searches for fresh, whole cadavers to work with.', '', 'Despite a ban, West and his companion carry on in secret, giving life to many corpses. None of the “successful” reanimations end well. Where Frankenstein’s creature was an unqualified success—except in its appearance—West’s creatures were inchoate, cannibalistic ghouls. While Frankenstein felt extreme remorse at what he’d done, West felt none at all. In fact, West is the true villain of the story, growing even more unhinged in his quest for fresh corpses, right up to murdering innocent people. After a long and dubious career of reanimation, West gets his comeuppance in spectacularly gruesome fashion at the hands of his many experiments.', 'Lovecraft was a student of weird fiction, as his essay,Supernatural Horror In Fiction(1927), bears out. He held Shelley’s novel in high esteem, writing, “It has the true touch of cosmic fear, no matter how much the movement may lag in places.” Lovecraft’s lurid story helped bridge the gap between Frankenstein’s proto-science fiction and horror genres like zombie tales. He wrote two more works of fiction on the theme of reanimation, the short storyCool Air(1928) and the novellaThe Case Of Charles Dexter Ward(1941). Both are macabre classics, though onlyCool Airbears any resemblance to the Frankenstein theme. In it, a man (the narrator) living in a New York brownstone apartment has a chance meeting with another tenant, a brilliant and eccentric doctor, who lives in the same building. The strangest thing about this man’s apartment is its extreme air-conditioning, which is perpetually set to freezing levels. One night, the mechanism breaks down and the air-conditioning fails. The doctor pleads with the man to keep him cool before mechanics can repair the system. He is kept in a bathtub full of ice that is continuously replenished, although the increasingly panic-stricken doctor insists that the pump be repaired. The narrator leaves the house the next morning to fetch mechanics to get the air-conditioning up and running, but returns to find the doctor’s lifeless body in a terribly rapid state of decomposition. He also finds a letter, where the doctor admits to have died almost two decades before. The doctor, who called himself the “bitterest of sworn enemies to death”, had successfully kept his own corpse alive until the fatal failure of the air-conditioning system.', '', 'Another pulp luminary influenced by Frankenstein was Donald F. Glut. Glut donned many hats in his long career from the 1970s onwards, including those of an amateur film-maker, a best-selling writer ofStar Warsnovels, a rock singer and a Marvel Comics writer. His late 1960s burst of Frankenstein novels and short stories are a marvel. Collected into two anthologies,The New Adventures of Frankenstein Volumes 1 and 2, in novels likeFrankenstein Lives Again!,Terror Of Frankenstein,Frankenstein Meets Draculaand more, Glut created an astonishing body of work that combined fan-fiction and monster mash-up in tales that are both entertaining and literary. Glut identified with Frankenstein and his ability and urge to create. His modus operandi was quite simple. He took Frankenstein and his creature and put them in situations where they faced off with werewolves, Dracula, the Mummy, Tarzan, and King Kong-like giant gorillas. In mixing all his favourite pulp pop culture artefacts—Hammer Horror movies, cowboy westerns,The PhantomandThe Shadowcomics, among others—Glut’s body of work is a Frankenstein’s creature in its own right, a postmodern Prometheus.', 'The 1970s seem to have been a notable decade in a Frankenstein revival. In science fiction, Shelley’s novel was given its now accepted place as the genre’s progenitor in Brian W. Aldiss’ landmark history of the genre,BillionYear Spree(1973). The same year, Aldiss also wrote a novel,Frankenstein Unbound, in which the protagonist travels back in time to an alternate reality Lake Geneva, in 1816.

It is about terrible and unhappy parents, terrible and unhappy children, and how, to misquote Philip Larkin, we pass misery back and forth.', 'You’re Victor Frankenstein, you think you’ve done your best, but here’s this monster you created, which refuses to be what you hoped it would be. Worse, it turns around and blames you for everything that’s wrong. Look at theParadise Lostline—Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay, To mould me Man?—which serves as an epigraph for Shelley’s novel, and then listen to director Guillermo del Toro, who is currently working on aFrankensteinfilm: “It’s the quintessential teenage book. You don’t belong. You were brought to this world by people that don’t care for you and you are thrown into a world of tears and hunger.”', 'Most parent-child relationships, when looked at over a period of time, bring high tragedy and slapstick comedy together in the same frame. Little wonder then that cinematic Frankensteins have inhabited every mode from deep seriousness to goofy, pseudo-science-driven humour—and that the most enduring films accommodate both extremes.', 'Consider one of the most effective scenes, gentle, idyllic and horrifying all at once, in James Whale’s 1931Frankenstein. Boris Karloff’s monster comes across a little girl, joins her in placing flowers on a lake’s surface and watching them float—and then, in all innocence, dunks her into the water too, causing her death. So iconic was this moment—often censored in early screenings—that 40 years later the Spanish director Víctor Erice made it the focal point of his coming-of-age narrativeThe Spirit Of The Beehive: the six-year-old protagonist Ana is traumatized when she watches the scene; in the days that follow, she becomes aware of subtler monsters in her own world.', 'Or see Whale’s 1935 sequel,Bride Of Frankenstein, in which Karloff’s plaintiveness—as the monster yearns for a companion who will love and understand him—brushes up against Elsa Lanchester’s brief but delightfully lunatic performance as his bride-not-to-be (the actress also played an impish Mary Shelley in a short scene).', 'Those are still the two best-knownFrankensteinfilms, and to modern eyes they can seem creaky and overwrought. Taking cues from theatre adaptations staged in Mary Shelley’s lifetime, they turned Victor Frankenstein into the prototype of the mad scientist, shrieking that he knows what it’s like “to be God” (in the book he is a diligent, conscientious man). But Karloff’s performance helps erase some of the differences. While the creature in Shelley’s novel gains in eloquence and dignity once he learns to use language, the “dumb” movie monster is sympathetic by other means, conveying childlike pathos through his gestures and expressions. In fact, one can argue that in the broader-comedy scenes where he grunts words—the refrain of “Good! Good!” when an old hermit makes him taste bread and wine—he becomes less likable.', '', 'Of course, there are other films where the monster is not meant to be at all likable—see the 1957Curse Of Frankenstein, starring those two masters of the Hammer Horror franchise, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and watch Lee play the role as a deformed, inexpressive zombie, starting with the shocking moment where he rips the bandages off his face as the camera zooms in on him.', 'Another dominant mode is that of parody mixed with affection for the source material. Mel Brooks’ 1974Young Frankenstein, shot in atmospheric black and white, has madcap scenes like the one where the doctor’s assistant brings along a brain labelled “Abnormal”—thinking it belonged to someone named “Abbie Normal”—but the film also understands the sense of wonder and danger that permeates the original story. This is equally true of three 1980s films—Gothic,Haunted SummerandRowing With The Wind—which aren’t straight renderings of the Frankenstein tale but dramatize the famous 1816 summer house party involving the Shelleys and Lord Byron, where both Frankenstein and the John Polidori horror storyThe Vampyrewere conceived.', 'And, of course, there are “serious” Frankenstein movies, which usually err on the side of earnestness. Kenneth Branagh’s 1994Mary Shelley’s Frankensteinset out to be faithful to the book, in a way the Karloff films never did, but the promise was marred by half-hearted execution—and ironically its best moments were the more inventive ones such as the scene where the naked creature (played by Robert De Niro, channelling a middle-aged Travis Bickle) slips about like a newborn baby in what looks like amniotic fluid.', 'Frankensteinis often regarded as the first true science-fiction novel, and this perception has become increasingly relevant in our time, where Artificial Intelligence has taken on forms that Mary Shelley couldn’t have envisioned. The idea of an imitation human being more humane in some ways than the flesh-and-blood people around him is a theme that has informed a lot of modern sci-fi about automatons: from the replicants inBlade Runnerto the 1999Bicentennial Man(adapted from Isaac Asimov’sThe Positronic Man) and Steven Spielberg’sA.I. Artificial Intelligence(based on Brian Aldiss’sSupertoys Last all Summer Long, and often seen as a futuristic version of the Pinocchio story).', 'But it’s just as instructive to go back in time, to two decades before the Karloff films, when a 12-minute Frankenstein was made by Thomas Edison’s studio in 1910. Watching this relic (you’ll find it on YouTube) is like getting into a time machine: given that the world of the Shelleys seems so impossibly distant to us today, it’s unsettling to realize that the Edison film is closer in time (a mere 92 years) to the publication of the book than to our present day.', 'What I find fascinating about that ancient film—as a cinema student and as someone who thinks of the Frankenstein story as being rooted in honest scientific curiosity—is how much it does with the very limited motion-picture technology of the time. For instance, for the challenging scene in which the monster comes alive, a wax replica of a skeleton was placed in a vat and set afire until it dissolved and crumpled. They then played the film backward, so that the impression we get is of something hideous being forged out of fire and sitting upright after its limbs have formed.', 'To watch that scene is to think of the imagination and daring required of early film-makers when they wanted to do something more ambitious than simply record reality. One could say those pioneers were kindred spirits of Victor Frankenstein, tinkering in their workshops until their children grew and became something vast and uncontrollable, slipping out of their godlike hands.']"

While sets were vandalized as early as January 2017, the Rajput Karni Sena threatened violence even  after the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) granted the movie a U/A certificate.

In an interview, Mehta spoke about how the maker of Dove soaps, Knorr soup and Surf detergents is preparing for the future. Edited excerpts:', 'You have reported double-digit volume growth in the December quarter. Can we take this to indicate market recovery and pickup in demand?', 'If we look at the period between 2013 and 2016, the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) market volumes grew at 3% whereas the GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of the country was, on an average, 6-6.5%. The GDP growth rate was ahead of the market volumes growth rate. However, during this same period till 2015, rural volumes were growing at 1.5-1.6 times that of urban volumes. It was in 2016 that the rural volumes came down and grew at the same rate as the urban volumes. The rural slowdown was a consequence of the two consecutive years of drought and inflation. Now, going forward, it would be fair to expect that India’s FMCG industry volumes growth should grow in tandem with the GDP growth rate of the country and that is based on the premise that we take steps to have more inclusive growth.', 'We keep talking about India’s huge growth potential, but we are yet to see consumption take off. When will it happen?', 'If we look at it from a purchasing power parity basis, we have now reached over $6,000 per annum and now, from here, even if we continue to grow at 6-7%, leave aside 8-9% that we aspire for, we will see the compounding effect as we have reached a certain threshold base. And if we repeat the performance of GDP growth rate of the last 25 years into the next 25 years, India will become a very different country. When I was out of the country for over 20 years, 20% of the population came out from below the poverty line into the lower middle-income bracket. If we keep repeating what we have done in the past, during our lifetime, India will become a very different country. So, I am very bullish about our country and for Unilever to realize its potential.', 'You spoke about inclusive growth earlier. But some studies have pointed out that India’s growth has not been inclusive and the gap is widening between the rich and the poor.', 'If you look at the figures by Thomas Piketty (French economist), it certainly indicates that there is room for much more inclusive growth. For us to reap the benefit of demographic dividend, we have to have inclusive growth. Inclusive growth would certainly mean that we would have to create more source of livelihood, more employment. Today in India, urbanization has not even started and if we step back and look at the last 20-25 years, India and China were at the same level of urbanization at about 25%. India is now in low 30s whereas China has crossed 50s. Now, urbanization will definitely put less stress on rural India but then the country will have to create jobs and the infrastructure.', 'The market is changing rapidly. How do you remain agile and competitive?', 'We have changed the structure of the company with ‘Winning In Many Indias’ (WIMI), where we have defined 14 clusters and are looking at competitiveness in each of these clusters at a granular level. Secondly, we have also defined country category business teams (CCBTs) led by young general managers who are fully empowered to deliver the results. So, this is a big shift where we have delegated authority on one hand to WIMI clusters and on to the other to CCBT teams. We have also redefined the roles that the different teams play in the organization. So, my leadership team now plays a very different role—their job is to look at scanning the horizon, looking at M&A opportunities, looking at capabilities of the future and where disruption can come from in the future. The running of the day-to-day business of a particular category is given to the CCBTs. So what this has done is that it has made the business much more faster and agile and has enabled us to unleash the huge energy of our youth. Among many reasons why we were able to navigate the GST and demonetization very well is due to this speed and agility. Our ability to respond to changing circumstances now is significantly higher than ever before.', 'What will the HUL of the future look like?', 'We are re-imagining HUL in every which way, from a culture perspective, organization, portfolio, capabilities perspective. This will evolve and change with changing times. But we are clear that we want to lead the change and we don’t want to follow the change.

An economist, microfinancier, farmer and social activist who started her work from Maharashtra’s Satara district, Sinha has dedicated her life to the economic empowerment of rural women. She moved to Mhaswad, a town in Satara district,  three decades ago when she married into a rural farming family. Coming from metropolitan Mumbai, Sinha’s first shock was learning that she had to defecate in the open since the house had no toilet. The household eventually did get one, but this was the start of Sinha’s journey of listening to what the community wanted, and eventually finding a way to get it organized and delivered.', 'Sinha, along with six other women, will co-chair the 48th World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting to be held at Davos between 23 and 26 January. This is the first time that the WEF panel will have all women co-chairs. The six women with Sinha on the panel include IMF’s Christine Lagarde, Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg, IBM chief Ginni Rometty, International Trade Union Confederation general secretary Sharan Burrow, CERN director general Fabiola Gianotti and ENGIE chief executive Isabelle Kocher. The focus at Davos is on “creating a shared future in a fractured world” and Sinha believes that as someone who has worked with marginalized communities, her voice will represent people belonging to a “fractured world”. Ahead of leaving for Davos, she tells us why the panel with all women co-chairs is a historic move at WEF, what she hopes the Indian Prime Minister will hear at Davos and why development of small towns is  key for India’s growth. Edited excerpts:', 'When the WEF talks about “creating a shared future in a fractured world”, what does the statement, especially in today’s time and age, mean to you?', '“A fractured world” according to me refers to marginalized communities, people who have been left behind in the development process, people like tribals who have been left untouched. I do not think fractured world refers to First World controversial issues. When WEF picks up this theme, it is about bringing issues of such people into the mainstream. I see “shared future” as a reference to these voices which must have a space. It is about creating a dignified future for those who have been left behind. When people talk about(a)fractured world, it is not just about access but inclusion into the mainstream.', 'From previously shared figures, about 75% of attendees at WEF are men. Will an all-women panel help to make a point about making workplaces more gender inclusive?', 'I see seven women being co-chairs as an opportunity and a responsibility. Davos is a place where heads of state come, where CEOs come, and whatever is discussed and debated in here is about investment, technology, business and science, compared to gender, social economic growth, etc. When at this platform, where corporates, investors, venture capitalists, head of states are present, and issues of gender are highlighted, you bring the discussion to the mainstream,  it becomes a statement.', 'Being at this forum, in this capacity, for me is a responsibility, because I will be bringing the voices of people from the fractured part of the world. Everyone knows the statistics about these issues, but how are we going to fix these? What are the solutions? My role here will be to get people to look into those. The sector where I work, microfinance and women empowerment, is ready for  a change, but it needs investment and I hope this will be a point of discussion too.', 'In terms of diversity, you are the only Asian in the all women co-chair panel, especially at a time when this era is being termed as the century of Asia. What do you think about this?', 'At least a starting has been made on the gender issue. I look at the positive side: an all women’s panel helps get the discussions about gender into the most mainstream of settings and this is always a good thing. I believe this will remove gender from being perceived as a soft issue and mainstream it.', 'What are the lessons that you have learnt while running Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, when it comes to why women find it hard to secure loans or to be a robust part of financial inclusion plans?', 'Our mainstream banking sector is poor in envisioning the needs and finding solutions for the rural poor and women. Over the years we have learnt many things. For example, while we worked in many weeklyhaats(markets), we found that the women who were saving with Mann Deshi still took out loans with the local moneylenders. When we asked them why they were willing to do this in spite of high interest rates, they explained that they did not want to be flooded with paperwork and also they wanted the money now, at their doorstep, with the ability to repay in a very short time at their convenience. The ease with which the moneylender provided was not something we were giving them. That’s when we realized that ease of banking is very important for women entrepreneurs as is customized banking. They wanted daily cash flows, daily repayment because their business models are such. These are the reasons why financial inclusion that we are talking about is not happening as fast as it should. Women need doorstep banking, it has to be easy for them and products should be customized. Banks need to do more research if they need to reach out to women. Bankers must also understand that lack of education does not mean people are stupid. Systems should not be more important than humans.', 'Another thing that banks and people who are dealing with financial inclusion for women must understand is that women do not want one common smartphone where the information of the banking accounts can be shared with everyone in the family. They want to control their finance and want their own smartphones.', 'The British Council’s 2016The State of Social Enterprise in Indiareport said that 24% of social enterprises are led by women in comparison to only about 8.9%  private sector businesses. What are social enterprises in India doing right to empower women?', 'What are perceived as hardcore businesses are often led by men but what are seen as soft positions such as heading corporate social responsibility or foundations is given to women. That is a stereotype you see everywhere.', 'Besides, most of India’s home-grown corporate world is about family business and this inequality of women representation is an inherited problem too. However, lack of women leadership is a problem in the First World too.', 'I do respect women for leading in the social sector and that’s why you see more innovation in these sectors. However, this lack of diversity will end up leading to losses to businesses eventually. If you included more women, with their styles of leadership, there would be more diversity, more innovations.', 'The Indian Prime Minister is attending WEF at Davos this year. What message as an entrepreneur, an activist and a banker would you like him to take back?', 'The most important thing I would say at Davos, which I hope everyone takes note of, is that India is a nation of entrepreneurs. I would urge  the PM to create a more robust system for entrepreneurs of all types. India has hosted a global summit on entrepreneurship, it has announced a dedicated fund for women entrepreneurs. It is a great time to invest in women entrepreneurs. We know manufacturing units can create jobs but how many jobs will these be? Ultimately, it will be entrepreneurs who will create jobs in India.', 'Mann Deshi, along with IFMR Investments, is launching the first Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India)-registered fund for women micro- entrepreneurs and I would like to see the Prime Minister create a supportive ecosystem for many such funds to flourish and eventually for mainstream financial institutions to make microenterprise loans as mainstream as microfinance is today.', 'To solve SIN (spillovers, important and neglected) problems, what support does an entrepreneur need?', 'We used to say India lives in its villages. Now it lives in the small towns. These spaces are vibrant since the young populace lives there. They are graduates, but don’t have jobs. Create an ecosystem that helps them to thrive in these towns. Have a chamber of commerce in a small town, think about business schools in these towns, run investment related workshops or clinics, and mentorship programmes. But all of this must go hand in hand. Otherwise what is the point of having a business school and MBA graduates in a place where there are no jobs or an ecosystem for creating employment. Learn to customize programmes based on what these small towns need and what resources are available. We can’t go around building malls, which First World cities have, just because that is what we have seen.', 'Also, create the agri-infrastructure in terms of cold storage chains. Farmers are producing but there is a paucity of warehouses and storage spaces. Create small warehouses that can store farm produce for five-seven villages. We will see immediate impact if a few things like this are done.', 'With Mann Deshi you have scaled deep (bank, education, microfinancing, cattle fairs), but what about scaling up (getting this model to other districts, or even at a global level)?', 'When I started out I never thought what Mann Deshi is doing today will be its area of work. But whatever I have done has all come from listening to what the community needs and wants at a particular time.', 'I think of Mann Deshi\xa0 as more of a community\xa0 organization and not just a bank, and that’s why we have scaled deep. We get ideas and the “wiseness” from the community as a result because they have their own way of dealing with things. Mann Deshi itself may not be able to go out to different geographies or scale up, but we can partner with others. Scaling for itself is not my goal; focusing on policymaking and setting precedents is important  like we did with Mann Deshi.', 'How much of innovation in the social space is about “new ideas” versus building on or improving an existing idea to solve a problem?', 'People continuously talk about innovation. In technology, there have been so many innovations, so many of which survived and others did not. The ones that really customized to a problem were the ones which solved them. I am not into applauding technology innovations just because they are a new idea. Unless an innovation can solve a problem, cater to a particular need of a person or community and has the capacity to scale at the market level, there is no point in it according to me.', 'With the release ofPad Man, a movie on a social entrepreneur, do you think it will encourage more people in rural India to look to solve SIN problems?', 'Such movies bring topics that are usually not discussed into the mainstream—and get people talking. Movies and celebrities in this country matter a lot. A movie likeDangalmotivated a lot of people in our area (Satara district, Maharashtra) to let young girls become athletes.']"

We are working with the motive of development for all,” said Modi.', 'On the performance of the BJP-led government at the centre in the last three years, Modi said some of its biggest achievements were the Jan Dhan Yojana (opening bank accounts), toilets in schools, 33 million families getting cooking gas cylinders, electrification of 18,000 villages, people being provided insurance in 90 paise and distribution and installation of LED lights.', '“The implementation of goods and services tax succeeded because of the federal structure of the country and NDA honours the spirit of federal structure.

Narayana Murthy, on Friday recommended introduction of securities transaction tax (STT) for investors in alternative investment funds (AIFs) in India.', 'The panel said if AIF investors are levied STT at various points of transaction it could yield STT tax revenues of $1.8 billion for the country during the next 15 years.', 'Bringing AIFs under STT regime will harmonize the taxation of mutual funds and AIFs and simplify tax compliance of the investors, the panel said in a 157-page committee report released by Sebi late evening.', 'The panel said AIF investors should be made liable to pay STT firstly at the time of entry when the investor purchases units, secondly, when income is distributed during the unit holding period, and, finally, when the investor exits by the transfer of units.', '“A simplified regime of taxation of investors in mutual funds has significantly helped in the growth of mutual funds with minimal issues and litigation. AIFs, like mutual funds, pool capital raised from investors which is invested in accordance with some stated investment criteria. Given the similarities in the structure of mutual funds and AIFs, a similar tax regime i.e. STT should apply to transactions in units of AIFs,” said the report.', 'AIFs are a common pool of funds –managed by a fund manager-in which institutional and high net-worth individuals invest, typically on a long-term basis. Private equity and venture capital funds are included as AIFs.', 'At present, due to the various complexities fund managers are discouraged from setting up Indian pooled and domiciled funds, said the panel. STT will help resolving the issue and help hedge funds industry in India to grow. A fair, transparent and enabling tax regime could result in India’s hedge fund industry potentially growing at 20% per annum from its current low base, the panel said.', '“Ultimately their assets under management could surpass $25 billion in 10 years…. In order to simplify and bring ease of compliance and remove ambiguity in taxes, the introduction of the STT regime (on entry and redemption for each investor) will ensure smooth payment and collection of taxes,” said the report.', 'The size of the AIF Category III funds, which mostly include hedge funds, is estimated to be Rs3,816 crores as of 30 June,2016. The global hedge fund industry has $3 trillion in assets under management as of 2015 according to Asia Hedge and HFR Global Hedge Fund surveys. From 2007 to 2015, while China’s equity hedge fund assets under management have risen from an estimated $13.5 Billion to $ 45 billion in 2015, the share of India’s equity hedge funds declined from 5% to 2%.', 'However, investors of Category III AIFs should be made to pay tax on income/gains arising from their investments, the panel said. Short term capital gains on transfer of units of an equity-oriented investment fund (whether by way of redemption or otherwise) should be taxed at the rate of 15%, the panel suggested in the report. But long term capital gains on transfer of units of an equity-oriented investment fund should be exempt from income-tax, the panel said.', 'The panel, which has suggested a number of other taxation measures for AIFs, seeks views on the report from stakeholders and the public comments till 19 February, 2018.', 'This is the third report by the committee, which feels certain measures are needed to address the problem of the levy of GST on fund management fees in AIFs.', 'The panel feels GST related issues and administration services fees deters foreign investors from investing in India-domiciled onshore funds through the AIF platform and instead encourages them to remain offshore.', 'According to the panel , considering the importance of VCs and PEs, the services rendered to an AIF should be chargeable to GST at a rate of 5%, if the majority of the investors of an AIF are foreign entities.', 'Alternatively, investors in an AIF should be deemed to be the service recipients and where the foreign investment in an AIF exceeds 50%, the services received by an AIF should be considered as export of services and thereby be liable for zero rate of GST, the panel proposed.', 'The current GST framework discourages AIFs involving foreign investors to enter India.', '“The GST paid on fund management fees and other input services become an incremental cost to be borne by AIF investors,” said the report.', 'Further, the panel has proposed an easier regulatory regime for the establishment of AIFs in an IFSC (international financial services center). The panel said any income earned by an offshore investor through AIFs in an IFSC should be exempted from tax. Also, there should be relaxation from filing return of income and obtaining a PAN number for offshore investors in an AIF in an IFSC, with regards to any income distributed by an AIF in an IFSC after deduction of tax at source, the report said.', 'Since AIFs domiciled in an IFSC will source funds from offshore investors, the current limits on overseas investments of Sebi-regulated domestic AIFs should not apply to IFSC-domiciled AIFs, the panel suggested. And, domestic fund managers/ sponsors should also be allowed to manage AIFs domiciled in an IFSC, the panel said.']"

Different parts of the world face different challenges. Where I come from, investors will still look for return before they talk about risk. On the other hand, say in the UK, I suspect it would be the other way around. Expectations are starting to get bigger and as an industry to be able to respond to that, there is a need for transparency and knowledge about what’s really happening underneath. This is not to dampen enthusiasm but to articulate the dynamics of the investment management industry better rather than simply taking instructions (from clients).', 'As an industry (investment management), we are better at talking about the good news than the bad news. To instil trust in clients, one has to talk about good and bad.', 'How much do the widely discussed geo-political risks in the global arena impact growth-oriented investors?', 'At the CFA Conference, Richard Koo, the chief economist for Nomura is talking about geo political risks as we speak. He just mentioned, for instance, during the great depression in the US, its GDP was reduced by 45% in 4 years. This is extraordinary for any economy and was catastrophic for the US. One assumes this could happen again given what’s going on. There is political unrest, there are extraordinary popularist Presidential candidates not just in the US but in other parts of the world too, driving economic decision making.', 'Part of our job is to try and make sense of it. As an institute we are more on the academic, educational framework. The research we have done through our members on what kind of skill sets will be important in the future tells us that the ability to have a conversation and make sense of the nonsensical world, ability to be transparent and make informed decisions are the key. It is about getting to know the individual, trying to fit what they need rather than talking about products. Risk management is an important skill set now, part of it has to deal with geo political risks today. People have different levels of understanding, but everyday we read a Trump tweet and that can potentially change the market. So, one of the skill sets of this job and certainly our focus from a continuous professional development perspective, its about making sense of the wider financial world from the point of view of an individual’s portfolio.', 'There is a lot of conversation about various risks and high valuations in some asset classes. However, the market is still optimistic, why do you think that is so?', 'It is almost impossible to find a report on India (this year) which is not super bullish about what’s going on. If you break down the performance dynamics, there is a very young dynamic population, you’ve got super growth across asset classes, policy reforms which add to the attractiveness of doing business and a willingness from a governmental perspective. I’m not the right person to ring the bell and say this is going to end on a particular date. It is again about understanding that markets don’t last forever and trying to find those parts of the market that have more sustainable growth, doing your research properly and being absolutely honest about what you are trying to achieve. What I have found during my lifetime as an investment management professional is that most clients will come to you with some fairly fixed ideas about what they are looking to do. You can either support them or challenge them. Lot of the effort that we put into the continuous professional development module is about improving interpersonal skills and have some challenging conversations. The norm should be not to take anything for granted.', 'There is a constant debate around asset management fees. How much is too much? What is an ideal balance for asset managers to make money and not over charge? Is performance-linked fee a solution?', 'I think it has to be an option. Historically, fees have been hidden. You didn’t know whether you were paying for research. The level of commissions being paid in a bundled approach have almost obfuscated how that works. Consequently, when people actually started asking the right kind of questions—in some parts of the world like Europe; this has determined a different approach towards transparency. This has a global impact. I have worked in private banking where customers are always okay to pay for performance. The argument from the corporate side has been that this is not a risk business, so we make money and lose money together. Customers should know what they are paying for. Having options is important.', 'We shouldn’t talk about fees without looking at passive and active (investing) and also fintech and its impact on the way fee structures will evolve. In Singapore, there is conflict with 104 private wealth management firms and less than five of them being profitable. I think its because from a compliance, technology and cost perspective compared to fees, things are moving in the opposite direction.', 'Our CFA mantra is all about transparency. We are not recommending one format over another. We are just saying that the customers you have, need to know exactly what they are paying for.', 'In India we are also trying to fine tune the role of distributors and advisers, with a push to remove overlaps. Advisers may not find it remunerative enough to serve the smallest investors, whereas distributors may be giving good advice. Are there markets (globally) where advice only is pervasive to all clients?', 'The answer is at the heart of the fintech revolution. From a commercial perspective, in my view the economics of a human adviser for investors with lower levels of wealth becomes harder and harder to justify. But I do think that fintech has, to some extent, democratized access to advice. It wasn’t that many years ago when, if you had a small amount to invest, nobody would be interested in you as a customer. Now you can go online. There is no minimum entry level in terms of advice you can get. I think these two models can sit side by side.', 'In terms of human advisers, there will be more focus on large and high net-worth investors because that is likely to be commercially more sustainable. I think that’s ok. I see more benefit than downside in terms of the overall impact on wealth management industry.', 'While regulation in India and in the developed world is evolving to a point where the clients’ interest is prioritised, what we see less of is penal action against distributors and advisers who are mis-selling, especially in an individual capacity. There is not much by way of deterrence. Why is that?', 'There are several issues related to this. First, regulators may see issues differently. So, the level of consistency may be lacking in resolving it. Second, being a little parochial for a moment, if a CFA charter holder operated in a manner that was against the code of conduct related to regulations in a market, we have a very detailed professional conduct approach. The ultimate sanction for us would be that they would lose their ability to carry the CFA charter. That may not be a financial fine but it is in this day and age if you are marketing your competence through a qualification, and you lose that, your ability to compete reduces.', 'I have seen different approaches from different regulators. I suspect in many ways the publicity that goes with amuck behaviour is something that regulators do think about when deciding the penalty to impose. I think it would be a mistake to think that companies aren’t taking this seriously. The increased investment in compliance, greater awareness of reputational risk impacting balance sheet value in my experience will matter in a customer service oriented business.', 'Some segments of the industry have been critical of the Indian capital markets regulator, saying it may be too quick in imposing some regulations, as the financialisation of savings in the country is at a nascent stage. Your views on this.', 'An interesting comparison would be with China. Maybe again if I relate it to the CFA Institute. One of the great challenges there is not increasing the number of candidates, it is finding roles for them to do once they are qualified. In China the industry is growing at the same pace. In India the industry is growing at a slower pace and I would say that is deliberate Government policy as it helps to manage the risks with a more conservative approach. Both have merits and downsides. The downside here in India would be that the industry could grow faster if it had less handcuffs. Having said that, there is a comfort level to the speed at which it is growing.', 'China is growing very quickly, at a municipal basis and the national basis. The doomsayers will point out that there will be a problem some day and people who have their glasses full will be able to take market share.', 'Yes, there is more regulation in India than some other parts of the market (globally). But I do understand, specially in terms of the young and to some extent inexperienced population—some modicum of control and conservatism behind the growth of the industry could be a sensible thing.']"

We want others to participate in our growth and want to participate in others’ growth as well,” he added.', 'When asked why PM has chosen to go Davos this year, Gokhale said: “My sense is that PM wanted things to change on the ground before speaking about them.

The reports raised concerns that the China may be preparing for another standoff with India.', 'Lu, however, said: “China’s position on the Donglong (Doklam) area is quite clear. Donglong always belonged to China and always under China’s effective jurisdiction.” There is no dispute in this regard,” he said asserting Chinese sovereignty over the area which is also claimed by Bhutan.', 'He said China is building infrastructure for its troops and the people living in the area. “In order to patrol the border and improve the production and lives of border troops and residents, China has constructed infrastructure including roads in the Donglong (Doklam) area,” Lu said.', 'He said China was exercising sovereignty in its own territory. “It is legitimate and justified.

Two decades and many medals later, she’s still inspiring a new generation of shooters","['Her right hand stretched out at a right angle to her torso, Chandro Tomar is absolutely still. A steady hand, she says, is what it takes to master a loaded gun. She would know. Since the late 1990s, Tomar has been competing and winning in the discipline of pistol shooting, a sport she only took up in the seventh decade of her life.', 'Her head covered with apallu, a baggy shirt spilling over aghagra(long skirt), Tomar is, for the most part, an ordinary woman from Johri village in Uttar Pradesh. But for almost two decades now, she has been an extraordinary ambassador for the sport and for her region.', '“The body may be old but the mind is not,” says Tomar, 86, who was in Mumbai recently to speak at the We The Women festival curated by journalist Barkha Dutt, presented by Facebook and UN Women. The conference featured several prominent speakers, including cricketer Mithali Raj, actor Alia Bhatt and lawyer Mrunalini Deshmukh. “One’s age can be anything, but there should be a zeal. I had it,” says Tomar.', 'She first won a medal—silver—in the North Zone championships in 1999, a year or so after she picked up a pistol for the first time. Tomar has since collected medals in competitions across the country, often vanquishing those much younger than her.', 'She would wake up early, finish the housework, supervise the tasks in the wheat and sugarcane fields, tend to the cattle, and when everything was done, she would go to the range to practise. At night, when everyone else was asleep, she’d work on the hand-stabilizing exercises, holding jugs of water, stones and bricks to improve steadiness.', 'Her shooting career started when she was 65. She took her 10-year-old granddaughter to a shooting range. But the girl was rattled and wasn’t able to load her gun. “Let me do it,” Tomar recalls telling the girl. “I can help you.” She pulled the trigger and hit the bullseye. “Everybody was shocked,” says Sumit Rathi, her grandson-in-law, who was helping translate when we met Tomar. “And they said, ‘Arrey dadi!’”', 'Until that moment, Tomar, who never had a formal education and was married at 15, was an average woman from an agricultural family in rural India.', 'And it took a loaded gun to change all of that. “It was just fun,” she says. It galvanized a sense of fearlessness and confidence. She laughed at the question of whether people fear her. “Robbers no longer come to our village,” she says.', 'At competitions, she might have heard the odd derisive remark about showing up in aghagra. Her children—two sons and three daughters—never said anything about her newfound passion, nor did her husband. But some of the extended family in the 40-person household did. “I shut my ears,” she says. “Let them say what they want.”', 'For the most part, she has retired from active competition, given the extensive public engagements and invitations she gets. Her last competitive event was in Delhi in 2016, when she won a bronze medal. Now, as an elder statesman of the range, she spends her time addressing gatherings, coaching youngsters and inaugurating facilities. And while Tomar has slowed down on competing, she shows no signs of stepping away from the game, continuing with coaching and mentorship. “Till my last breath,” she says. “I will give my life to this game.”']"

Wipro added $358.2 million in new revenue in 2016-17 to report a 4.9% growth. In the current fiscal, the firm needs to add $377.5 million in incremental revenue to match that pace. This means Wipro will have to add $129.2 million in incremental revenue in the current  fourth quarter to match last year’s growth.', 'For Wipro, revenue from digital offerings recorded a 46.1% growth to $505 million in the December quarter against $345.61 million in the June quarter of 2016, when the management first disclosed digital revenue.', 'However, Wipro’s overall quarterly revenue inched up 4.3% to $2.01 billion from $1.93 billion in the same period. This was largely on account of a 4.55% decline in traditional business to $1.50 billion from $1.58 billion, according to aMintanalysis. One fallout of this shift is on the workforce. Wipro saw its workforce decrease by 1,206 people to 162,553 employees, after its headcount fell by 3,031 people in the second quarter.']"

On the one hand, there is the fear of losing out on an opportunity to make money hand over fist by investing or trading in bitcoins since their price rose by around 20-fold since the start of 2017. On the other hand, there is the nagging feeling that one may end up investing in a virtual currency whose price is extremely volatile and whose true value cannot be assessed.', 'Adding to the confusion, most governments remain non-committal on the legality of bitcoins since it is not regulated by central banks. Some have explicitly warned investors to exercise caution while those like the Indian government have begun imposing a tax on the gains from the sale of bitcoins.', 'For instance, soon after the South Korean government said on 11 January that it plans to ban cryptocurrency trading, the news sent bitcoin prices plummeting to $13,945 on 12 January on the futures exchange CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange).', 'Further, citing unnamed sources,Bloombergreported on 15 January that China is clamping down on cryptocurrency trading.', 'The fact is that a bitcoin has value only because believers in this virtual currency buy and sell it among themselves.

Hackers then demand a ransom in bitcoins to decrypt the documents that they have encrypted using the malware.', 'Why, then, do bitcoins still hold an appeal?', 'For one, bitcoins are not regulated by governments. Not yet. Second, a bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that runs on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that contains details of every transaction, allowing a user’s computer to verify the validity of each transaction of this virtual currency. Hence, the transactions are transparent to every user.', '', 'Third, a digital signature protects the authenticity of each transaction, which is why the digital money is also known as a “cryptocurrency”.', 'Fourth, anyone can use specialized hardware to process transactions and earn a reward in bitcoins for the service. The process is known as mining. Of course, this is an expensive exercise.', 'Fifth, it is easy to buy bitcoins. In India, you can buy bitcoins from dedicated exchanges like Unocoin or Zebpay by downloading apps or using websites. You can buy bitcoins using your local currency (e.g. the rupee) from any online banking service (or through NEFT/RTGS). Further, you can purchase bitcoins in smaller denominations too, which implies that even if a single bitcoin looks beyond your wallet’s reach, you may be able to buy a fraction of it.', 'Selling bitcoins is also easy as the money gets directly deposited into your bank account. Users, though, will need to undergo the know-your-customer (KYC) process and provide details such as their permanent account number, address proof and bank account details. Moreover, exchanging bitcoins for rupees or dollars involves a transfer fee.', 'Bitcoin appears to behave like a Giffen good because unlike what the law of demand in economics dictates, the demand for bitcoins increases despite an increase in its price. And a big reason for this trend is the fact that the supply of bitcoin has been capped—there are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever be in circulation. Currently, there are around 16.80 million bitcoins in circulation.', 'However, after the last whole bitcoin is mined, thus reaching the upper limit, the value of the currency is bound to obey the laws of supply and demand.', 'Big companies that currently accept bitcoins include WordPress.com, Subway, Microsoft, Reddit, Virgin Galactic and Expedia.

He wrote, “...in theory, yes, if it proves capable of facilitating transactions at a low cost and/or providing better risk-adjusted returns for portfolios. In practice, however, the bar looks high.”', 'However, on 11 January, the CEO of the multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, asserted that “I can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end.”', 'Despite these dissenting views, experts agree that even if the bitcoin does not survive as a form of money, its underlying technology—blockchain—holds promise and will find wide acceptance in the industry.']"

This was food at its best—simple, fresh and directly from the source. “We want to showcase traditional Malnad or Uttara Kannada food and most of it is made with the produce that we grow on estate,” says Chandini D.M., founder and chief executive officer of Golden Wood Eco Holiday Homes. There is at least one local speciality prepared everyday based on the season and availability. The chefs whip upchiglichutney made with the red fire ants that weave their nests in fruit trees which grow abundantly around the estate.Kalule(bamboo shoots) andakki alubu(rice mushrooms) are made into curries or dry fries. “We encourage our guests to pluck and eat fruit straight off the many trees surrounding the cottages,” says Chandini.', '', 'Another homestay in Sakleshpur, with a similar approach to food, is Mugilu. Located a little beyond Sakleshpur town, in the middle of a 10-acre coffee and pepper plantation, Mugilu is far removed from the bustle of the city with bird song filling the air. The food served here features rustic and hyperlocal recipes with almost everything grown on site. We sampled dishes like ahagalakayi gojju(a spicy bitter-gourd curry) withakki(rice) orjolada(jowar/sorghum)rotis. Thepulaoswere garnished with diced pineapples; the custard at the end of our meal had juicy lychees in it. For breakfast, we gorged on bananas and rose apples. When there is an exceptionally good crop, some of the fruit is turned into wine and squashes. Mugilu was started by advertising professionals Chandan and Sapna Gurukar, who left city life in Bengaluru to settle down here and their idea of food had a large part to play in it. “We think that the essence of local dishes and traditional recipes are being lost in the cities and that is why we try and focus on that experience here and interact with our guests, especially during their first meal and educate them on the concepts of healthy, naturally grown (without the use of pesticides) produce. Our all-natural (growing according to the capacity of the soil and what will grow best in it) plantation grows tomatoes, chillies, greens, beans, brinjal, pumpkin, and a variety of cucumbers, bitter gourd, sweet potato and mustard leaves.” The estate has numerous fruit trees; their passion fruit juice and wine are delicious and the guava and jackfruit jams, a delight.', 'Meera and Praveen Khanna, who run Silver Oak Farm on the slopes of Nandi Hills, around 65km from Bengaluru, have a similar food philosophy. They always invite their guests to walk through the garden and see all the produce up close. Thepaneer(cottage cheese) that they serve is made from the milk that comes from the farm’s cows. Produce from the farm, which is grown naturally without any pesticides, takes myriad forms—bitter gourd and gooseberriesare turned into pickles, andkarondasand guavas are bottled into fragrant jams.', 'Cinnabar, a homestay in Kodaikanal, about 465km from Bengaluru, also believes in the organic way. “No one understood our methods when we first started,” says K. Balakrishnan, who owns and runs Cinnabar. “But when they tasted the food, the difference was evident.” A vegetable that is freshly picked and cooked a few hours later, tastes completely different from those that have travelled a long distance in cold storage,” says Balakrishnan. The Cinnabar kitchen also focuses on making international dishes with local grains. Balakrishnan explains that the idea is to adapt to the local context. For example, the hummus here is made with locally grown butter beans instead of chickpeas. They also make a couple of varieties of artisanal cheese. Everything from beans, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes and tomatoes to the whole gamut of salad leaves and microgreens is grown on the farm. Fresh homemade jams are served at breakfast.', '', 'For those who can’t take out the time to go as far as Kodaikanal, Earth Kitchen in Hessarghatta, a short drive from Bengaluru, is an easy option. This farm is home to self-styled weekend chef and full-time gardener Arati Venkat and her husband Naved. It is open to the public on weekends only. The couple is now in the process of constructing their homestay and this facility will be available soon. “For me, farm-to-fork has never been about luxury. Rather it is about absorbing the colour palette of nature,” says Venkat. “Recently one of our guests was quick to recall the fragrance of the lemon balm herb I used in the tea infusion and asked for it again. It is small things like this that make what I do pleasurable.” Venkat’s garden yields produce that finds its way into a range of Mediterranean-inspired dishes, like a delicious Garden Salad with crunchy bell peppers, cucumber, radish, pomegranate seeds, cherry tomatoes and star fruit and tossed with a citrus dressing. Every ingredient is drawn from the farm’s well-designed kitchen garden and it is a pleasure to see what you are eating is grown barely a few yards from your plate.', 'Such farm experiences with their fresh ingredients and home-cooked meals are a great reminder of just how gorgeous the bounty of nature can be.

ITC hotels already offer destination-discovery programmes such as “Food Sherpa”, where a hotel chef takes guests on a culinary tour of the city. “Creating unique experiences will become a key differentiator in a crowded marketplace,” says Haksar.', 'Travellers want to mingle with locals, and hotels will need to facilitate that. Jean-Michel Cassé, chief operating officer, India and South Asia, AccorHotels, says, “At Novotel hotels, we are introducing opportunities for our guests to mix with locals through activities such as yoga sessions, guitar lessons and art classes to make our hotels more sociable places for locals and visitors alike. We will also create shared workspaces and invite local entrepreneurs into our hotels to work and socialize.”', 'Tech support', 'The growing use of technology in the hospitality sector is a no-brainer. “Hotels are now incorporating technology to up the overall experience of the guests. It is thrilling to have your hotel door opened using a unique code on your phone and not a traditional key,” says Peter Kerkar, group CEO, Cox & Kings Ltd. Adarsh Noronha, country manager, Oracle Marketing Cloud (which provides cloud services to Taj Hotels), agrees. “In the coming years, a tech-driven experience will become central to a hotel’s success. From booking, to service, to check-out, technology will transform customer experience phenomenally. Think Web check-in, key-less entry, room customization, pay-by-app, etc.,” he says.', '', 'Free internet has already become de rigueur, but high-speed internet for multiple devices is what today’s tech-savvy traveller expects, says Sharat Dhall, chief operating officer (B2C), Yatra.com. It’s all about anticipating customer needs, and transferring control from the hotel to the guest, according to Haksar. “ITC Hotels was the first in India to introduce ‘Welcom-e-Butler’, an iPad-based room control and entertainment solution that gives the guest a vastly enhanced in-room experience,” he says.', 'Getting social', 'Millennials, increasingly driving the change in hospitality, expect to interact with hotel brands in real time. “Feedback from millennials is taken seriously by hotels given that this generation will rule consumerism in the future,” says Kerkar. This is where social media has been a game changer, moving beyond content sharing to actually influencing decision making. “People are sharing their experiences almost real time, so hotels need to be right on top of what kind of experiences their guests are talking about and respond rapidly to that,” says Dhall. Several hotels now offer concierge services via social media with very prompt response rates, notably ITC Hotels (@ITCHotelsCares) and Hyatt (@HyattConcierge).', 'AccorHotels has taken it one step further. “As a part of our digital transformation, we are very adept at ‘social listening’ across all platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. As an example, we are able to listen in to the conversations with key words like birthdays or anniversaries and with geo-fencing technology, can use those inputs to help individual hotel teams go the extra mile in creating guest delight,” says Cassé. Similarly, at Taj Hotels, the Taj.Live Command Centre hosted at the group’s Mumbai office, tracks social media mentions in real-time and assigns tasks directly to the respective hotels and team members, reducing customer response time significantly.', 'Design first', 'Standard hotels with cookie-cutter rooms no longer cut it with Indian travellers. “Travellers are looking for individualization—they want a hotel that stands out from the crowd,” says Cassé. Internationally, AccorHotels has launched an “open house” concept with Jo&Joe (a luxury hostel with a living room and kitchen space) and invested in two existing lifestyle brands—25hours Hotels and Mama Shelter, all of which are highly individualized, themed hotel options.', 'Another design change that we are likely to see is the hotel business centre making way for co-working spaces, says Dhall, while Kerkar believes a nature-inspired design that tries to minimize the hotels’ carbon footprint is the way to go. “A design that would let in natural sunlight (thus saving electricity), grass walls, open passageways for breeze and including abundant nature in the backyard; the future lies in sustainable infrastructure,” he believes.']"

However, Kavi Arya, a professor at IIT-B’s computer science and engineering unit, explains that what appears to be a simple urban terrace garden exercise is actually a test-bed for engineering students to experiment with technology.', 'Prof. Arya, who heads this project called k-Yantra, points out that IIT-B has “automated the drip irrigation” using the Internet of Things (IoT) concept which enables “things” like sensors and gadgets to be connected any time, any place, and with anything or anyone.', 'The valves for drip irrigation, for instance, are powered by batteries and communicate with a Raspberry Pi server—a series of small single-board computers. “Based on a fixed schedule or by sensing the humidity in the soil, the actuators (devices that convert energy into motion) can be triggered,” Prof. Arya explains. Some M.Tech students at IIT-B are also working on a solar-powered actuator to automate watering of the plants.', 'IIT-B usesamrut mitti(loosely translated as “nectar soil”) that comprises 1kg cow dung, 1 litre cow urine and 50mg jaggery. This soil is sprinkled on layers of soaked leaves in each trough, following which six types of seeds are planted, according to Prof. Arya. When the seeds start sprouting, the green shoots are trimmed and mixed again with the soil to “get a very potent mixture that is also pest-resistant,” according to Ajit Harpude, a project assistant.', '', 'Prof. Arya points out that students learn a lot about technology from this exercise. For instance, harvesting is a challenge and “machine learning (ML) can be used to identify a specific fruit or vegetable and harvest it automatically”, he says.', '“We started with five labs (in other colleges) in Mumbai and are showing them how to use technology for urban farming—how to make these valves, actuators, etc.,” says Prof. Arya. He now wants to extend this idea to help people living in urban areas set up neighbourhood farms while youngsters could use technologies like drone- or robot-based planting of seeds to automate the process.', 'K-Yantra is part of IIT-B’s larger e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC), which is sponsored by the ministry of human resources development under the National Mission on Education and is supported by IIT-B. Prof. Arya conceived the idea for e-Yantra in 2009 when teaching a course on embedded systems. The distance education began by educating batches of faculty members from engineering colleges all over the country. The team initially believed they had the “magic ingredients to make engineering learning and teaching very exciting” but soon met with failure because the colleges, where the distance education was being imparted, did not have the adequate infrastructure or robots.', 'So IIT-B designed a robot with the help of Mumbai-based Nex Robotics, which was founded in 2006 by IIT-B faculty and students. The robot is a micro-controller platform with many sensors (like proximity and motion sensors). It has a display screen, which can communicate wirelessly using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The upper portion of the robot has a processor that can be changed according to specifications. “It costs around Rs30,000 with accessories. We are now in the process of having more vendors to manufacture it. The form factor, design and idea (Intellectual Property, or IP) is with IIT-B,” says Prof. Arya.', 'IIT-B simultaneously decided to package theory and practice by holding a robotics competition. The institute received 4,000 registrations in 2012. However, training the students on the IIT-B campus in such large numbers would have proved a “logistics nightmare”, so the institute decided to give the students a robot, and lectures on a CD to help them learn to program the robot on their own.', '“We give them a real-world problem, abstract it as a game with a rule book to help objective scoring. Students have to solve the problem and upload a video. We evaluate the videos and call them for the finals. We, then, tweak the theme. This formula has worked well,” says Prof. Arya, adding that in 2017, they received about 24,000 registrations from all over the country.', 'The winners are offered a six-week internship at IITs that also includes “lectures on history, investment strategies, soft skills, theatre workshops and even meditation besides field trips”, says Prof. Arya.', 'Chinmay C., a fifth semester student in the electronics and communication department at the RV College of Engineering in Karnataka, was one such beneficiary of this inter-disciplinary learning during his internship at IIT-B. “The e-Yantra summer internship programme has provided a wonderful experience,” he says, adding, “working late nights, exploring new stuff, making new mistakes and learning from them, and never giving in despite failures,” were some of the “new things that I have learnt.”', 'IIT-B now has 280 laboratories across the country. The principals of the engineering schools who want these labs have “to commit to investing Rs2 lakh and provide four teachers across disciplines (engineering, etc.) to be trained and pass all our workshop training tests for about three months.” All teachers have to complete the tasks (primarily, programming the robot), failing which IIT-B does not set up the lab. “If they succeed, we have a virtual inauguration and give them three robots and certificates,” Prof. Arya says.', 'Consider the case of Dattajirao Kadam Education (DTKE) Society’s Textile and Engineering Institute at Ichalkaranji in Maharashtra. It is the first nodal centre of IIT-B for the western region and mentors 14 engineering colleges in the region. “We have our own robotics labs and conduct many robotics competitions,” says Prof. D.V. Kodavade, head of the computer science and engineering department at the engineering institute.', 'This year, for instance, some students in the western region have “used the Galileo Gen 2.0 and Raspberry PI platforms” and built a  mobile phone-based fire-fighting robot and a staircase-climbing spider robot. Additionally, they developed a staircase-climbing spider robot, an automatic lawn grass-mower robot; an accelerometer-based robotic arm and a motorbike navigation and control contraption using IoT. The students even built a pick-and-place-type robot for textile mills that can handle bobbins on spinning machines to cater to the numerous mid-sized textile mills in the region, according to Prof. Kodavade.', 'About 60,000 students have participated in the robotic competitions organized by IIT-B in the last eight years.', 'The next step, according to Prof. Arya, is to engage these students with the local industry. “Now they have manpower that can see a problem and build a machine. When we send these students out to companies, they can help small and medium-sized enterprises to build a scale prototype that can automate processes and reduce operational costs,” he adds.', 'IIT-B is also talking to the information and broadcasting ministry to convert e-Yantra’s annual robotics competition into a reality show. According to Prof. Arya the idea is to make engineering appealing to families and get the parents of engineering students to “get the conversation going”. He concludes, “automation is killing jobs so we need to create more entrepreneurs who can make such innovative devices.”']"

Presiding over the middle is the glass-fronted eating room of Hotel Meghdoot, where all Mall Road’s fringe-tailed dogs take care to position themselves. Finally, there is Raju Taxi and Tour Service, which operates from an Alto. And then the market ends.', 'What will my shop sell? I am not sure. But in my head it is a warm, happy place where glass jars with freshly baked biscuits sit on shelves of sweet-smelling pinewood. In the corner is a bubbling coffee pot. Maybe my friends who actually have things to sell, such as hand-knitted sweaters and brinjal pickle, will use my shop. There will be books and dogs. Probably not for sale.', 'My desire for this shop has grown ever more intense after the emptiness that follows on the completion of any large piece of writing.', 'At the end of the two or three years I spend writing a book, it is as if someone plunged an ice-cream scooper into me and took everything out. All that is left is a shell. This shell floats in a soothing sea of fantastical dreams.', 'There is time to both sleep and dream after a novel is done. When I am writing, I don’t sleep much. I keep waking up, feverish with a thought I can’t let go of and don’t want to lose, and have to reach for a notebook to scribble things I can’t decipher in the morning. I go for walks with people who are as yet real only to me. It is an odd and exhausting way to live, and many in the same job describe writing as agonizing pain. I have never found it to be anything but exhilarating, even if in a fractious, defeated way sometimes. I would not do it if it were otherwise.', 'But at the end of three years or so of all this staying awake and talking to people in my head come the deserts of vast eternity when I don’t know if I will ever write a book again.

I want a little shop from which I can observe a succession of sunsets and dooryards and sprinkled streets. Idleness acquires meaning this way. A shopkeeper isn’t just sitting there chatting; she can justifiably claim she is at work. What are literary festivals or book fairs but glorified shops where gossip is exchanged, wine drunk? Maybe some work happens too—nothing that would not get done without going to fairs and festivals.', 'Just around the time I finished my new novel last year, one of the two tailors on Mall Road—the junior one—threw in the towel.

He sits on the floor in a cascading mountain of half-cut fabric before an ancient Singer sewing machine and mainly does what is calledoltrasun(alteration) whereby baggy old jeans are changed to trendy drainpipes. Mamaji’s secret, I am certain, is his ability to be absent from his shop more or less constantly because he prefers gambling at cards under a tree down the slope, where fortunes are made and lost every day. His tailoring skills have become mythical from being demonstrated so rarely. His unsmiling visage pre-empts questions about pending shirts and trousers.

But I’ll open my shop when I want to and leave it to lounge on the western parapet across the road when the sunshine there looks tempting.

And I realized how elegant they are. Now, I find myself wearingkurtaswith Patiala pants. They have found a way into my wardrobe now.', 'If we were to look inside your wardrobe, what else would we find?', 'You will find a lot of dresses. I’m a curvy girl and I like silhouettes that come in at the right places (like the waist) and flow out at the right places. I dress for my body type, so I don’t necessarily take trends into consideration that much. I fluctuate in terms of colours from very monochromatic on one end and bright block colours on the other. I’m a huge white shirt fan. It’s my little black dress. I have a few different styled white shirts: the classic that I’ll wear with jeans or high waist-ed pants and skirts and evenlehengas. You can wear a necklace with it or tie your hair up. I have some cropped white shirts, some with tails, and my current favourite is a Dsquared white shirt. The Italian fit is perfect.', '', 'So style for you is individual to each body type rather than what’s trending at large?', 'A woman’s body is so elegant. Style is knowing how to champion your body. We all have our own expression. When I was younger, my friends used to joke that I wear costumes, not just normal clothes. I didn’t know how to wear just jeans and T-shirt. There has to be some element of expression, like crazy big earrings, or a bigbindi. That’s what fashion is for, a bit of transformation has to happen.', 'Do you find that you can compromise comfort for fashion?', 'There have been moments, for instance, at a wedding, when I’ve worn the most fabulouslehenga, even if it weighed 10 kilos. Or I’ve worn heels even when they’re killing my feet, or the most amazing earrings even though my ears hurt. But it’s a slight departure from compromising on comfort. I like to have fun. By the end of the night, I might be dancing and my heels are flung somewhere, my earrings are in my handbag and mylehengais knotted up or tucked in, so that I can dance. There’s a point where, yes, I want to come in and look fabulous, but through the duration of the night, I’ll eventually get comfortable and just express myself and have fun.', '', 'You’ve lived in many cities around the world. Tell us about the sartorial influences you picked up along the way.', 'My mother is a Gujarati from Kenya. I was born in Mombasa. Tribal art, photography, vibrant Masai colours and patterns are part of who I am. My father is Swiss Jewish. In my growing years, we lived in Switzerland and I love clean, minimalist lines and angles. We moved to London afterwards, and the city is so cosmopolitan. The architecture and design is so fantastic. It really opened my mind. For school, I went to New York, and I remember walking into college in heels, where everyone was in trainers, and they looked at me like “what are you doing?”. London, and Europe in general, is more elegant and dressy. America was about jeans and T-shirt. It brought out the more comfortable, functional wear for me. And then there’s India (she moved to India in 2011). Just discovering what is it within Indian fashion that really spoke to me has been so wonderful. I love the big Bengalibindi. I love Kolhapuris. I’m a Sabyasachi loyalist and love his kind of low bun and middle parting look. For me, it’s about mixing Eastern and Western influences, like wearinglehengaswith shirts and satindhotipants with a little crop (top). I’ll wear a beautiful black gown for a black-tie function, but instead of earrings, I’ll wear amaang tika.', 'Apart from Sabyasachi, which designers do you return to?', '', 'I love Stella McCartney. I feel conscious of the kind of fashion we consume, and she’s a pioneer in fashion being ecologically conscious. Plus she cuts amazingly well for women and  I love her slightly androgynous style. I like fun resort-y clothes like Zimmermann and Mara Hoffman. For jeans, I always go to rag & bone.', '', 'Films are clearly a source of style for you. Any stars or an era that particularly speaks to you.', 'I’m a fan of the Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Brigitte Bardot era. They were so elegant and sophisticated. I love the sex appeal that Sophia Loren, Catherine Zeta Jones and Monica Belluci brought to film and fashion. I feel currently, there’s such an overdose of social influencers. Yet I will look at, for instance, the Golden Globe Awards to see what everyone was wearing. It’s amazing how within the confines of black, each actors’ gown was so individual and expressive of who they are as people.']"

Titled The Shawl Project, it is led by Tata CLiQ Luxury, an online portal of curated luxury labels by the Tata group. The e-commerce platform invited 10 Indian designers to craft “a one of a kind shawl each”, says Vikas Purohit, COO, Tata CLiQ, as he explains the consumer insight that led to the project.', '“There’s a certain kind of woman who doesn’t like to flaunt a logo. She looks for a story in a garment, she cares about how it feels on her skin, if it has a heritage, if it has been produced in an environmentally conscious way. The Shawl Project is for that woman,” says Purohit. Earlier in January, Tata CLiQ associated with The Wool Mark Co. and has become their retail partner for the International Woolmark Prize (which was recently awarded to Indian designer label Bodice). The shawls are made in a Merino blend of silk and cashmere.', 'If it’s storytelling that we are seeking, then there are 10 individual stories here. Rahul Mishra took inspiration from the iconic latticework at the Sidi Saiyyed mosque in Ahmedabad, and rendered it in a shawl completely covered in embroidery. Aneeth Arora visualized intricate Venetian lace work and created a lightweight shawl combining lace and wool yarn. For Barve, a shawl is a metaphor of how India is today. “The Indian woman is as stylish in a sari as she is in a slinky jumpsuit. The shawl for me is perfect canvas to capture such an East meets West sensibility,” he says on the phone. He aptly calls his creation the Little Black Shawl. For Pankaj Ahuja of Pankaj & Nidhi, its a childhood memory that he associates with a shawl. “To me the shawl has a personal connotation. It embodies a woman’s, specifically a mother’s love. There is a unique quality of an embrace in it,” says Ahuja on the phone.', '', 'The Shawl Project also brings out a clear reflection of each designer’s signature aesthetic. Raghavendra Rathore’s black on black weave with a slim border is an elegant, restrained piece of work; typical of the designer. Rajesh Pratap Singh revived an old three-shuttle technique of hand-weaving that allowed him to create a double-sided weave: coarse on the outside, soft and silken on the inside. Manish Arora’s shawl can be spotted from a mile away: bright pink with iridescent appliques. Other designers, including Zubair Kirmani and Amit Aggarwal, similarly, use the versatile shawl to express their ongoing explorations: the Shalimar Bagh of Kashmir and recycled polymer strips woven to create a striking metallic effect, respectively.', 'The shawls, priced Rs1.5 lakh onwards, are available for retail on Luxury.tatacliq.com/the-shawl-project from 25 January; shipped across India.']"

They say things like “Your empathy is really stellar” and “My sense of stability has never been more out of whack”. And they’re always in motion—or at least that’s whatAll These Sleepless Nightsmakes it seem like. Michal Marczak’s film follows two young Warsaw residents, Michal and Krzys, as they bounce from one party to another, blow off steam with angsty worrying, and generally live a life without visible responsibilities. It’s shot by Marczak himself in the manner of Emmanuel Lubezki, regular cinematographer to Terrence Malick and Alejandro González Iñárritu; the camera dives and swirls and seems intent on conveying the thoughts of the protagonists.', 'As an immersive look at contemporary Polish rave culture, this would have been a striking film, but what makesAll These Sleepless Nightsone of the most exciting cinematic experiments in recent memory is how it blurs the line between fact and fiction. Though the film won the directing award in the World Cinema—Documentary section at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, it isn’t exactly non-fiction. Krzys and Michal weren’t actors, but young men Marczak met at a house party. They drew on their own lives for their “performances”, and the film follows them for a year and a half as they hang out, party and fall in and out of love.', 'Marczak brought the ever-readiness of guerrilla film-making to his semi-fictional story. “We had everything prepared, always, for any occasion: rain, underwater, everything,” he toldMovieMakermagazine. “Everybody was always on the phone on standby. We could really be any place in the city within 20 minutes and do our shoot.” This commitment to capturing elusive revealing moments lends a vivid immediacy to almost every scene in the film. You know certain reactions would have been discussed beforehand, movements choreographed, but it all looks so real. And who’s to say it isn’t?', 'Inasmuch as any film can be regarded as the truth—you are, after all, watching only the maker’s truth, a subjective cutting and arrangement of moving images—it is documentary that’s supposed to carry the burden of authenticity. Yet, from the start, non-fiction film has shown a tendency to shake off this burden. Explorer-prospector-director Robert J. Flaherty’sNanook Of The Northis one of the first great documentaries—the life of an Inuk hunter, captured with an eye for dramatic detail. Only, as it turned out, several of the details that so dazzled audiences in 1922 were Flaherty’s embellishments, including the substitution of a traditional spear for Nanook’s regular hunting gun. Nanook wasn’t even Nanook: his real name was Allakariallak, and his “wife” in the film was actually Flaherty’s companion.', 'Even before he began making movies, Orson Welles was pulling wool over people’s eyes—or ears, with his realistic-sounding but entirely fakeWar Of The Worldsradio broadcast in 1938, which convinced several listeners that aliens had landed in New Jersey. His debut feature,Citizen Kane(1941), is one of the most influential films of all time, and very modern in its challenge to audiences that they would not be emerging from the theatre with any clear “truth” regarding the central character. Three decades later, abandoned by the studios and making films on the fly, Welles would further muddy the relationship between fact and fiction, artist and viewer.', 'In 1972, Welles told critic Jonathan Rosenbaum that he was making a film on art forger Elmyr de Hory, his biographer Clifford Irving, and millionaire inventor Howard Hughes (who Clifford wrote a fake biography of). “A documentary?” Rosenbaum asked. “No, not a documentary—a new kind of film,” Welles said. That it certainly was. There’s nothing quite likeF For Fake(1973), which is about whatever Welles told Rosenbaum, but also about Picasso, Oja Kodar (the director’s partner), magic tricks, the 1938 radio broadcast, and the making of the film itself. These various strands of deception are tied together with brilliant associative editing and the smoothness of Welles’ baritone—saying so much, saying so little.', '', 'One strange detail aboutF For Fakewas that it was funded with Iranian money, and had its premiere at the 1973 Tehran International Film Festival. Could this screening, and possible subsequent ones, have meant that it was seen and appreciated by budding directors who’d go on to make their own sly, rough-edged, quasi-documentary films? Abbas Kiarostami’sClose-Up(1990), in particular, is difficult to imagine without the influence ofF For Fake. Though the two films have different techniques and philosophies, they are united in their determination to continually shift the narrative sands under the viewer’s feet.', 'When Kiarostami read about a man named Hossain Sabzian, who’d impersonated director Mohsen Makhmalbaf—posing as him to a couple and taking money from them to make a film—he thought it might lead to something. So he went to the prison where Sabzian was being held and interviewed him, and somehow inserted himself in the courtroom during the trial. Then, he got Sabzian and the people he misled to play themselves, restaging, with a few adjustments, the events that resulted in the man’s arrest. The result certainly isn’t documentary, but is it fiction? The courtroom scenes are real, as are the scenes in jail. In a sense, it’s all real. Sure, it’s “performed”, but what we think of as real life in documentaries is also a performance, a face presented to the world.', 'This idea of performance in documentary was used, in one of the more astonishing acts of cinematic rebellion, by another Iranian director, Jafar Panahi. Placed under house arrest by the authorities and forbidden from directing, he “co-wrote” and appeared inThis Is Not A Film, a 2011 documentary about Panahi not being able to make a film. Of course, he was, and this film was followed by two more in the same vein,Closed Curtain(which unfolds in Panahi’s house) andTaxi(like Kiarostami’sTen, set in a moving vehicle).', 'Around the time Panahi was stretching the nature of docu-fiction in Iran, directors Joshua Oppenheimer and Christine Cynn were bending documentary reality in a different way inAn Act Of Killing(2012). Anwar Congo and Adi Zulkadry, hired killers in the Indonesian genocide of 1965, recreate their murders for the camera as lurid genre film pieces. The result is supremely unsettling, though perhaps not as disorienting asThe Thin Blue Line(directed by Errol Morris, one ofKilling’sproducers) was for viewers in 1988. That film included re-enactments of key scenes from the crime being investigated: based in fact, but shot like a neo-noir film. This soon became a common documentary  technique: a step away from received ideas of “reality”, perhaps, but a way to enhance the effectiveness of the film.', 'When it came time to shoot with the couple he’d conned, Sabzian, the central figure inClose-Up, developed cold feet. Kiarostami tried to persuade him, telling the man he hadn’t lied but had “told a truth that’s beyond reality”. This is a beautiful encapsulation of what these films, perched on a wire between reality and fiction, set out to accomplish. When Krzys slow-dances on the streets at the end ofAll These Sleepless Nights, oblivious to the vehicles winding around him, it’s both real and unreal. Reducing moments like these to one or the other is an unnecessary restriction on the poetic possibilities of cinema.']"

Moving from a business-to-business sector—in both domestic and export markets—she is now presenting her first retail collection of Ikats for home and apparel at an exhibition titledIkat Eyein Mumbai.', 'There is a strong graphic design influence in Desai’s work, who graduated from the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, in 1980—bedspread  in broad, bold strokes, a table runner that reproduces the pattern of piano keys, wall art that resembles sea waves. Desai brings a fresh perspective to Ikat. She plays with technique and proportion. In some fabrics, the motif has been enlarged to such an extent that there are no repeats. In others, she minimizes the Ikat pattern, so that it looks similar to a digital print. The pastel colour palette of peach, onion pink, powder blue and more, “make it quite apt for sun dresses”. Desai’s  sensibilities are modern and minimal. “There is little that is tradition-based, most of it swerves towards the contemporary,” says Desai.', 'Desai’s collection has been one year in the making, but her experience in the field spans the last three decades of working with various craft forms of India.', '', 'Her introduction to Ikat, however, happened by accident. “Sometime after graduating from NID in the 1980s, I was going through a book on Kasuri, the Japanese form of Ikat, by the publisher, Graphic-Sha. On a whim, I wrote to them about Indian Ikats, and they telegrammed me and fixed a meeting with their director,” she says. A few months later, Desai had signed a book deal with the publisher. For eight months she travelled to the three Ikat regions of India: Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Patan in Gujarat, and put togetherIkat Textiles Of India, a book documenting the textile, later re-published by Thames and Hudson and Chronicle Books.', 'She then branched out to other craft forms. In the late 1980s, she went on to work with Sally Holkar of the Rehwa Society in Maheshwar. “They were replicating tradition. But I was thinking transparency, how to avoid repeats; I approached it like a graphic designer. Since I wasn’t a textile designer, I wasn’t shackled by technical impossibilities. That collection came out to be very different,” says Desai. Later in the 1990s, she worked on a project with the late architect Charles Correa while he was designing the Jawahar Kala Kendra museum in Jaipur. “Charles asked me to research Rajasthan art and I ended up working with craftsmen to produce a set of 139 murals for the museum,” she says.', 'Desai is self-admittedly not a purist. But she vows by technique. “I bring my own graphic design sensibilities, a taste for modernism, but one has to learn the technique, so that you can go beyond it,” she says. The newness she brings to her Ikats clearly stems from this intent to go beyond. “Ikats have a lovely aesthetic of feathering in the way that they are woven. But it is not always revered. For instance, Ikat in Patan is about precision. I had to devise new ways to enhance the feathering, something that was perceived as negative. I’m not so hung up on traditional values. I think we should speak to our contemporary living,” she says.', 'Ikat Eyeis on till 21 January at Coomaraswamy Hall, Kala Ghoda, Mumbai. Price, from Rs1,500-20,000.']"

Craggy fingers of crystallized snow, imprisoned for decades in Argentina’s Perito Moreno glacier, clawed at the blue sky. Just a 2-hour drive from the charming little frontier town of El Calafate, the 5km-long glacier is located in Patagonia’s Los Glaciares National Park. It is one of 350 glaciers in the Southern Patagonian Icefield, the world’s third-largest ice mass after Antarctica and Greenland.', 'Gazing at it off the side of a cruise boat, we heard a great roar; a cry of pain as an enormous chunk of ice calved off the scar-faced wall and crashed into the water, setting off a miniature tidal wave. Repeatedly, the brute hurled frozen boulders at us and thundered a warning not to get any closer. The boat’s captain took no chances and maintained a safe distance from this awesome work of art; a work in progress crafted by nature over millions of years.', 'Later, however, we did get to almost touching distance of this giant mass of compressed snow and ice when we walked across a boardwalk that zigzagged down the face of a hill facing the glacier. At times we were so close that we could feel its icy breath and look deep into the eerie blue caverns that pitted its face. Yes, this lumbering, slow-moving frozen blue wall was an awesome beast; a ruggedly handsome one that commanded our attention to the exclusion of everything around it.', 'On our return to El Calafate, we raised a toast at the Yeti Ice Bar, to the giant ice cap that we had just eyeballed.']"

Balki on working with Twinkle Khanna and Akshay Kumar, and the challenges of making a film about a real-life character after previously avoiding biopics","['Which came first: Twinkle Khanna’sThe Sanitary Man From A Sacred Land(from her collection of short stories) or R. Balki’s script, the basis for the forthcoming feature filmPadMan? It turns out that both were being written simultaneously, without collaboration or symbiosis. The commonality, of course, is that both Khanna’s short story and Balki’s film are retellings of the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, the Coimbatore-based creator of the low-cost sanitary pad-making machine. Muruganantham has been the subject of documentary features such as Amit Virmani’sMenstrual Man(2013), but he didn’t part with the film rights to his life story till he met Khanna and Balki. “For one-and-a-half years I didn’t answer them. I first met Twinkle in London and said I would agree only after I met Balki and could explain myself to him. And after seeing Akshay (Kumar) inToilet: Ek Prem Katha,AirliftandOMG: Oh My God!, I had the confidence that he will do a good job playing me,” says Muruganantham on the phone. Based on a screenplay by Balki and Swanand Kirkire,PadManis co-produced by Khanna and features actors Akshay Kumar, Radhika Apte and Sonam Kapoor.', 'For Balki, who was approached by Khanna and Kumar to develop this story into a film, adapting a real-life story was a departure. The director of films such asCheeni Kum,PaaandKi & Kahad consciously steered clear of biopics until he began exploring Muruganantham’s life. During one of the conversations with Muruga, as he is affectionately called, Balki says he was struck by how his model of success and fame had been inverted. “Muruga said he wasn’t a charity organization—though he knew he was doing good for women, he also said he was in a business where making money (by increasing the cost of pads) would make his venture flop. He said, ‘Only if I don’t increase profitability do I have a business. I will become famous but I will be the first famous man who will be the poorest man. Everyone thinks that by becoming rich you become famous, but I want to say that by not being rich you can be famous too.’”', 'Balki and Kumar were also drawn in by the opportunity to do something new. A Bollywood film with songs and a star that spotlights sanitary pads is a novel idea. “This story was so out of the box. A film on sanitary napkins has not been made, and I had the opportunity to do it with a very big star,” says Balki. The broader motivation for the director and the co-producer, Khanna, is to encourage a conversation on a subject that largely remains taboo in India. During the research phase of the film’s development, Balki says he spoke to a number of agencies, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and research firm Nielsen, and was astounded by the low numbers of women who use sanitary pads—not just in rural areas, but even in metropolitan cities like Mumbai.', '“I learnt that, by god, there is a big, huge problem,” says Balki. “At least 30-40% of women in Mumbai do not use pads, so can you imagine the statistic for the rest of the country? There are varying reasons for the stigma—from blind beliefs and superstition to price points and privacy. A pad may cost only Rs5, but Rs50 a month is a lot of money for people who are saving every paisa to give three meals to a family.” This is the gap Muruga has plugged: producing a low-cost pad-making machine which is now available in 29 countries.', 'Balki’s hope is thatPadManacts as a catalyst for conversations. Muruganantham believes that, thanks to the film, the conversation has already started. “Cinema can drive these issues,” says Balki, adding that he had taken a few liberties and  “reinterpreted Muruga’s life. He has lived that life, but what can I add to it? That is my ambition as a film-maker. I told him, I don’t want you to applaud me for getting your life exactly right. I want you to say, I wish my life had been a little bit more like this.”', 'When asked about the tandem writing process and how Khanna and he kept their manuscripts separate, Balki says, “I didn’t know what she was writing and she only partially knew what I was writing. In fact, both her story and my script were finished at the same time. Each one is a different interpretation, but all the credit for writing this film goes to Muruga, because anybody who could write a life like that leaves very little for us to write after that. We can only interpret it.”', 'Balki and Kirkire wrote the film keeping in mind Akshay Kumar as the central character, Lakshmi. AfterAirliftandToilet:Ek Prem Katha,PadManseems like an easy fit for Kumar. Balki agrees that while Kumar is not a man who courts controversy, he is also not shy of taking on challenges. “PadManis possibly the riskiest film he has done. Akshay looks at ideas the way I do—if it has not been done before, it is not a risk but an opportunity.”', 'The writer-director, who has shifted his focus almost entirely away from advertising to feature film direction and production, identified one common trait in his lead cast. “Neither Akshay, Radhika or Sonam talk about schools of acting, cinema, performance, etc. They come on set, do their scenes, crack a joke and go. But they come completely prepared, with all their homework done, and they make it look effortless. I have realized what an amazing actor Akshay is. He underplays his skills, but he has such instinctive understanding of a character. He gave the 11-minute speech we shot in the UN in one take. I know he is rehearsing like crazy and he really works at it, yet he doesn’t get overawed by the complexity. This film is really about all three characters.”', 'With this experience, Balki reaffirms that adapting real-life stories is “exhausting”. He prefers to mine his imagination for future scripts. “There must be a supreme reason for me to do a real-life story. I even find adapting books a handicap. A film stays for three days or a week and the only joy you have is the content you have created. Good or bad, at least it is your thought. How ever much this film works, I will always give credit to Muruga, because it is his life. I have not created his life. I have only tried to ensure I don’t destroy it. The joy of being associated with a life will be there, but the joy of creating a life will not be there,” says Balki.', '“Cinema can also give back to life,” he adds. “The fun of cinema is not in the making of it—that’s labour. The fun of cinema is in the thinking of it. If the thinking has been done by somebody else then what is the joy in the labour?”', 'PadMan’srelease has been pushed from 25 January to a later date.', '']"

The modest homes of this middle-class neighbourhood sit clustered together amid schools, playgrounds and Buddhist temples. There isn’t anything remarkable about this part of the city at night—except for one home, where the distinct clamour of industrial machinery reverberates till the early hours of morning.', 'In the courtyard of this single-storey home, painted a startling shade of green, a group of five women and a few men take turns to churn large pots of bubblingkenda—a traditional Sri Lankan porridge that is especially popular for breakfast. There are various types ofkenda. The most well-known iskola kenda(kolameans leaves in Sinhalese), a Kermit-coloured concoction made with a variety of greens, blended with cooked rice and coconut milk.', 'The women who are in charge of production at Lanka Hela Osu Pen—or Sri Lanka Herbal Drinks, a small-scale business venture aimed at empowering low-income households—labour through the night to produce four-five kinds ofkenda, includingkarapincha(curry leaf),meneri(millet), sau (sago),kurakkan(finger millet orragi) and, occasionally,kithulpiti(starchykithulflour, made from the dried pith of the foxtail palm).', 'Varying in flavour and texture—from vegetal to earthy; and thin to viscous and gummy—thekendasare prepared in keeping with traditional nutritional wisdom, and are generally considered a wholesome way to begin the day. Although there is little scientific literature available on the specific benefits of each type ofkenda, some popular ingredients such asgotu kolaor the fan-shaped leaves of the Asian pennywort, are considered superfoods.', '', 'Colombo rises early, and since busy office-goers looking to grab a quick breakfast form the bulk of the customer base, the group works the graveyard shift. Starting shortly after midnight, they work until 5.30am to make approximately 30 litres ofkenda, to be sold at 12 standalone stalls and offices across the city.', 'It is clear that this is a complex operation that requires coordination and collective effort. Sunitha Ranjani Suraweera, 55, dressed in a green T-shirt and a denim skirt, continuously stirs a pot of dull brownkurakkan kenda, while others around her pick large bunches of curry leaves, scrape coconuts using an improvised, motor-run scraper and squeeze the grated coconut to make coconut milk. As the person in charge of making sure all thekendasare perfectly proportioned and seasoned, Suraweera has a hefty responsibility, one that she wears lightly.', 'After thekendasare cooked, poured into insulated dispensers, and dispatched to stalls across the city, Suraweera gets ready for the second part of her job. For another 6 hours, she manages one of the stalls located nearby, finally wrapping up her day at 12.30pm (most of the other women who make thekendawrap up their shift at 6am). It is gruelling work, without doubt, but it gives Suraweera, who was a seamstress for 30 years, a sense of ownership and pride. “I like makingkenda—it is a good product because it improves health,” she says with a smile.', '*****', 'Lanka Hela Osu Pen is the brainchild of Inoka Jayawardena, a grass-roots political worker-turned-social entrepreneur; Suraweera’s daughter, Danushka Shri Nishanka (who goes as Danu), and her husband, Lasitha Anuradha. The trio kickstarted the project in 2013 to help women become financially independent, with an initial loan of LKR 250,000 (around Rs1 lakh) from a local bank. The initiative picked up steam when they got a larger loan from the state-owned Regional Development Bank. The project was also designed to enable low-income households to overcome debt, which is a widespread problem in Sri Lanka.', '', '“Many women enter a cycle of taking loan after loan at high rates from moneylenders and microfinance institutions to meet the family’s needs, until they find themselves against a wall,” says Jayawardena. “They often don’t know where to turn and feel great shame, so they stay away from home and avoid meeting people.” By instilling a sense of entrepreneurial drive, Jayawardena has encouraged the women involved in the project to fight their way out of debt.', 'For Champa Abeysekara, a 44-year-old mother of four sons, the intervention came at a particularly difficult time. Two years ago, having incurred loans of over LKR 600,000, the family was forced to sell their house and move to a rented place. Eager to give her sons the best academic opportunities, Abeysekara joined thekendaprogramme.', 'Abeysekara’s daily routine is a rigorous one. After helping out with the cooking until 6am, she manages akendastall until midday. Following this, she runs a juice and snack stall at one of the city’s leading public schools, finally wrapping up her day at 4pm. She earns LKR 600 per day for a 6-hour shift—the standard rate for all the production staff at Lanka Hela Osu Pen. In addition, she earns a commission of LKR 7-10 per cup ofkendasold, and makes some additional money from her canteen sales.', 'Abeysekara wells up while discussing how far she has come. “Earlier, I felt I didn’t have the strength to deal with my problems,” she says. “Now, I am able to earn money and I have the support of the group.”', 'In addition, the various roles she plays during the course of the day have helped her identify a latent skill. Since her stall is located in a part of the city with a high concentration of government offices, she has the opportunity to interact with officials. “I like all aspects of the job but I especially like to talk to customers,” she says.', 'The demands of the job have fostered an environment of interdependence among the group. Suraweera, her daughter and son-in-law live in the same house where thekendais produced. With all three of her immediate family members busy through the night, it often falls on the other women to care for Inuki, Nishanka and Lasitha Anuradha’s eight-year-old daughter. Abeysekara combs and braids her hair and someone else chips in with breakfast before Inuki is packed off to school at 6am. “The women who work in thiskendaproject support each other,” explains Jayawardena. “In part, that is responsible for their strength.”', 'Unlike an industrial unit, thekendaprogramme has relatively little machinery—just a couple of industrial blenders, a separate one for leaves and rice, two coconut scrapers, a few large pots and pans and a few dozen insulated steel dispensers that keep thekendawarm. Given this spartan setup, it is clear that a sense of community (and elbow grease) has been instrumental in helping the group to gradually scale up its operations from 20 cups in 2013 to 1,000 cups five years later. The business now also makes a small profit, which covers rent and utility bills.', 'Over the years, the business has swelled to include more than 70 people involved in different stages of the manufacturing and production process. This includes farmers who grow the green leaves in Embilipitiya, in the south-central part of the country; others who cultivate millets such asmeneriandkurakkan; leaf pickers who clean the produce; stall sellers and truck drivers, among others.', '', '“There is a lot of interest in expanding this model to other provinces,” says Jayawardena. “But it is difficult to get loans to re-lend to people to start their own businesses.” Besides, the country’s high rate of inflation—a leading cause of debt—has proven to be a hindrance. “This is a very expensive business, because all the raw materials are costly,” says Lasitha Anuradha. “Five months ago, 50 coconuts used to cost LKR 2,500. Now they cost LKR 4,500.”', '*****', 'As dawn breaks and the day’s cooking comes to an end, the women offer me a taste of the freshly preparedkendas. Thekola kendamade ofgotu kolais savoury, the herbaceous flavour of the leaves enhanced by creamy coconut milk. It is served with a small square ofhakuruor palm jaggery. Themeneri kenda, made ofprosoor white millets, is mildly sweet, while thesau kenda—my favourite—has plump grains ofsabudanaor sago and boiled mung beans generously enriched with jaggery. Thekendasare expertly seasoned and cooked, and a testament to the skill of the women who make it.', 'It is only fitting that for the women of the Lanka Hela Osu Pen, the biggest reward for their labour is an intangible—and unquantifiable—one. “Earlier, I had a lot of worries,” says Abeysekara. “Now I have peace of mind.”']"

Also called “big boy” food, these are foods that focus on meat, high carbs and there is no shying away from the fats or fries. Asian chefs are the newest entrants on the dude food bandwagon who are expanding its scope beyond super-sized burgers and high up on this list is Singapore-based chef Bjorn Shen. Known for his unusual approach to food, he is transforming what is conventionally considered “junk” into a fine-dining experience.', 'Although he shut his speciality dude food restaurant Bird Bird in November, the food party still continues at his flagship restaurant, the Middle-Eastern fine-dining spot Artichoke, where guests can partake in Shen’s signature brand of cooking that he calls “dudestronomy”.Loungecaught up with the chef on his recent visit to Mumbai where he collaborated on a special menu with Gresham Fernandes, culinary director at Impresario, which owns restaurants like Smoke House Deli and Social. Edited excerpts from an interview:', 'You are regarded as a “rebel chef” and your restaurant specializes in “deviant Middle-Eastern food”. What do these labels mean?', 'I am someone who likes to mess with things and I suppose that is why people call me rebellious. I have been called many things from the bad boy of food to culinary gangster and I often don’t know how to react to these names. When I cook Middle-Eastern food, my first step is to learn the tradition well. I believe that you can only mess around with tradition if you first learn how to respect it. I learnt authentic Middle-Eastern cooking back when I was at university in Australia from my Persian and Arab friends and their mothers and grandmothers. When I opened my own Middle-Eastern restaurant in Singapore, I used this knowledge and put a funky and modern café spin on traditional dishes. We are very clear that our food is not authentic Middle-Eastern cuisine but one that is inspired by the region’s flavours.', 'What draws you to dude food?', 'I am very inspired by what I call “fat boy” or dude food. Dudestronomy is the highly scientific word that I have given to my style of cooking (laughs). The idea behind it is to take something that is very humble, lowbrow or even outright junk and elevate that using good ingredients, creativity and skill. If you apply these three things to chunky comfort food, you can get something pretty awesome. For example, we have a dish called the Beet Mac, which is our take on the McDonald’s Big Mac, which features beetroot falafels, a Big Mac sauce, fermented pickles, roasted lettuce and so on. I am very familiar with fast food dishes like a Burger King Whopper or a KFC Zinger and I reconfigure them to a fancy restaurant dish with the same components but treated in a very different manner. And while the dish itself might look colourful and deconstructed, when you eat it there is an immediate twang of familiarity. So the food at Artichoke is a mix of serious food and fun food. About 20% of the menu is in a humorous  vein and apart from fast food, we are also inspired by movies. In fact, the movie that made me want to open Artichoke wasYou Don’t Mess With The Zohanwhich is filled with hummus references and if we want to put a strange dish related to hummus on our menu, we call it a dish inspired by the Zohan.', 'What is your take on sustainable, local and seasonal cooking?', 'So that was a direction we had taken one year in 2015 where we championed local foods but we stopped doing it since. We discovered that it was near impossible to do this in a place like Singapore which imports nearly 95% of its stuff. If we were only to use local ingredients, we would never eat bread, rice, noodles because there is no wheat or paddy grown here. Chicken, pork, lamb and beef would also be off the menu as would most vegetables and we would only eat frog and crocodile and lettuce and mushroom as they are the only things that are abundant locally. There is also no notion of seasonal food in Singapore—if something is not in season in the northern hemisphere, it will be available in the southern hemisphere and we have access to it all. Of course, it comes at a cost as everything comes from overseas. Honestly, we try our best to be sustainable but we also stay realistic. If it comes down to making a choice like buying cauliflower from Holland or a cauliflower from Malaysia, I will obviously choose the latter because it’s less food miles. However, I will also not compromise on the kind of wines that we serve in my restaurant which come from all over.', 'What is your favourite ingredient?', 'This might come as a surprise but my favourite ingredient is Doritos tortilla chips. You can do so many things with Doritos. If I could be a lifelong ambassador of the brand, I would, as I have used it in so many ways—from American-style grits with Doritos to a fried fish with a Doritos crumb and a crushed Doritos tabbouleh.']"

One thing I’m wondering about: Why hasn’t Facebook taken the hatchet to the “like” button?', 'Mark Zuckerberg says he wants more “meaningful social interactions” on Facebook. He doesn’t want people to spend so much time scrolling around aimlessly on Facebook or otherwise passively wallowing in the social network. It turns out that behaviour makes people unhappy, or at least that’s what Facebook’s own researchers have said.', 'Well, it seems the “like” button—and related reactions like the crying face or heart—are part of the problem. Clicking “like” is the opposite of meaningful or social. It’s a superficial way to interact with people. And that’s exactly the type of activity Facebook is trying to weed out.', 'It’s clear from what executives have said that “likes” will be less important as a signal for determining what each of us see in the news feed. But that “like” button is still there. People click on it billions of times a day. On Wednesday, I clicked “like” on a Facebook friend’s engagement photo. But that wasn’t meaningful. It was the internet equivalent of a half-hearted wave hello.', 'It wasn’t always this way. The “like” button was introduced 10 years ago by FriendFeed, which some of us remember as a website that helped people find interesting things from across the internet. Facebook was apparently working on its own version at the same time, according to this short history from Facebook veteran Andrew Bosworth.', 'The feature was delayed in part because Zuckerberg was skeptical of it, according to Bosworth. But the “like” button was introduced in 2009, Facebook acquired FriendFeed later that year and we know the rest. The “like” button became a defining feature of Facebook—a huge version of it greets you as you drive into company headquarters—and an organizing principle for the whole internet. Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, YouTube and Netflix all have some version of the like button to help quantify what’s popular and determine what is worth showing to millions more people.', 'The beauty of the button is it’s an easy way to show someone you’re paying attention, and to see what people around us think is worth seeing. “Liking is pretty easy; that’s the whole point of liking,” Facebook executive Adam Mosseri said in recent Wired interview. Yes, it’s easy, but it’s too often a replacement for more meaningful interaction that Zuckerberg is trying to encourage.', 'I’m not saying killing the “like” button would solve all the company’s problems. There are no silver bullets for Facebook’s ills. But it’s clear that some of the defining features of social media and the internet had unintended consequences, and they’re becoming too glaring to ignore. One of the defining characteristics of YouTube has been that anyone can upload a video, and maybe make a living from their favourite hobby. YouTube is rethinking that now.', 'We can see in 2018 that the people who helped shape what the internet is today are starting to rethink some of its foundations. And the “like” is one of the fragile stones on which the internet was built.Bloomberg Gadfly']"

I calculate that figure was 33.8% last year, down from 34.7% the year before. TSMC sees it declining in coming years, and ranging between 20% and 30%.', 'Flat spending and rising revenue mean one thing: more cash.', 'TSMC isn’t the kind of outfit that invests in startups or plays the stock market. Chairman Morris Chang, who retires this year after 31 years at the helm, has created a company that’s about as conservative as any when it comes to fiscal discipline.

But for investors, it’s probably getting a little out of hand, and certainly isn’t an efficient way to manage a balance sheet. I suspect TSMC understands this and has been hearing from shareholders wanting a bit more back.', 'TSMC has already been doing that, having raised its dividend payout since 2015, but there’s room for more.', 'With all the hullabaloo about revenue getting a bump from Bitcoin mining chips, it’s important to remember that such a surge is likely short term, and limited.

What was once a paved thoroughfare, used by hundreds of disciples of the globe-trotting Indian ascetic, is today covered with moss that requires visitors to mind every step.', 'Even as the impressive architecture of the buildings along the main walkway is hidden with foliage of plants splitting through the concrete, the giant hall inside, where the Maharishi gave his sermons, is a burst of colour. The hall is airy and spacious with a large platform at one end. Graffiti in all sizes adorn the walls, lending a colourful character to what fans have christened the “Beatles Cathedral”. While not much signage or information is provided at the ashram, the graffiti has been painted over the years by those who managed to sneak in with cans of spray paint and their love and loyalty for the British band from the small city of Liverpool who won over the world.', 'A black and white hand-painted portrait of the Maharishi dominates the centre of the platform; from here he would address his disciples. Alongside the small flight of three steps leading to the platform,  a line is scribbled in red ink: “With every mistake we must surely be learning.” It is a throwback toWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps, a song that Beatle George Harrison had written and composed in 1968 as a comment on the tensions and discord gripping the rock band. The scribbled line could well encapsulate a 50-year-old tale.', '', 'A passage to India', 'On a crispy cool wintry afternoon in February 1968, film-maker and photographer Paul Saltzman sat near John Lennon and Paul McCartney as The Beatles practised two lines they had just composed of a song. Saltzman happened to be present at the ashram in Rishikesh during the band’s visit.', 'McCartney, in a whitekurta-pyjama, looked at ease in the surroundings. Drummer Ringo Starr hung around in a Nehru jacket and provided rhythm by snapping his fingers while Lennon and McCartney sang and strummed on Martin D-28 acoustic guitars. Sitting near them, Saltzman’s eyes followed McCartney’s reading from a piece of paper on which was scribbled the refrain:Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, life goes on, brah, La la, how the life goes on.', '“McCartney told me that those were the only two lines they had so far. The two of them kept singing the chorus and played around with it. But what shone through was the joy infused in their music at that moment,” says Saltzman over the phone from Ontario, Canada. “John and Paul were working as equals and the four of them (including George Harrison) were like a family of brothers out there in Rishikesh when I met them.”', 'Fifty years on, the Rishikesh stint of the Fab Four, as The Beatles were often referred to, stands apart as a cultural signpost, as it marked the entry of Indian music and spirituality in Western mainstream pop culture. The seven-week-long stay at the ashram resulted in The Beatles composing the bulk of the songs for their ninth studio album,The Beatles(more famous asWhite Album); a phase when, as Lennon described inThe Beatles Anthology(2000), he wrote some of his best songs. Over 30 songs were written during their ashram stay, includingBack In The USSR,Dear Prudence,Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da,The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill,While My Guitar Gently WeepsandI’m So Tired. “The quiet of the ashram, the daily meditation, healthy lifestyle and vegetarian food allowed their creativity to blossom and it was possibly the most artistic phase of their career,” says Saltzman.', 'US-based music critic and author ofThe Unreleased Beatles: Music And Film(2006) Richie Unterberger considers the Rishikesh trip to be “very important” to the career of The Beatles. “First, because they were away from Beatlemania for the first time in five years and away from a hectic work schedule for the first time since 1960, they had less distractions from songwriting,” he says on email. “Second, because they only had acoustic instruments with them, many of the songs they wrote in Rishikesh had an acoustic, folky flavour, as you can hear on theWhite Albumtracks likeJulia,Dear Prudence,BlackbirdandMother Nature’s Son. Because they spent a lot of time practising meditation, they might have allowed thoughts buried in their subconscious to surface. As a result, their time in Rishikesh might have been the most prolific in their songwriting career, yielding such an abundance of material that their next album, theWhite Album, became a double LP and not a single one.”', 'Before their 1968 visit to Rishikesh, The Beatles were in India twice. The first, on 8 June 1964, was during a stopover at the Calcutta (now Kolkata) airport en route to Hong Kong. That visit, Beatles fansites remark, passed off uneventfully, with a crowd of girls waiting for them when the plane touched down—a phenomenon of screaming fans that they encountered during refuelling stoppages in Beirut, Karachi, Kolkata and Bangkok.', '', 'Around the time of their second visit, this time a one-day layover in Delhi on  6 July 1966, enormous fame and furious controversies had caught up with the band. Before arriving in Delhi, the band had been troubled by rightwing elements in Japan and roughly booted out of the Philippines for not having attended a breakfast meeting with the then first lady Imelda Marcos at the presidential palace. The band found hordes of fans waiting at the Delhi airport and along the route; fans on scooters gave chase, shouting “Hi Beatles, Beatles.” The fansite Beatlesbible.com quotes George Harrison as saying, “Oh no! Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but Beatles have nowhere to lay their heads.” Harrison, nevertheless, found time during the brief stopover to indulge in a passion that had gripped him by then—the sitar. The band went looking for these at Rikhi Ram and Sons’ musical instruments shop in Connaught Place. Later, some were sent over to their hotel room for them to try out. The previous year, when The Beatles released their albumRubber Soul,with Harrison playing sitar over the deeply introspectiveNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), a sore point was the cheap sitar going slightly off-key. This one bought from India had to be perfect.', '', 'The dark horse', 'If anybody was steering the band towards India and all that the country possessed, musically and spiritually, it was Harrison. “The Quiet One” could also have been the one with the most inherently seeking nature. In the mid-1960s, when rock music in the West was seeking new musical frontiers and challenges, a 20-something Harrison discovered the sitar and his guru, sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, in June 1966 in London.  They remained friends till Harrison’s death at age 58 in 2001. For some critics, the sitar and his Indian classical music-influenced compositions gave Harrison his own niche in a band where Lennon-McCartney held the creative reins. For others, it was an essential component of Harrison’s search for meaning in life.', 'The sitar was part of Harrison’s journey and with it he wanted to understandsadhana(meditation) through the highest Indianguru-shishyatraditions, says Kolkata-based tabla player and composer Bickram Ghosh, who toured with Ravi Shankar for many years and played on Shankar’s albumChants Of India(1997), which was produced by Harrison. In 1999, Ghosh got a call from Harrison, asking him to play on the title track of his forthcoming albumBrainwashed(released posthumously in 2002). Ghosh spent a week recording with Harrison at his mansion in the UK’s Henley-on-Thames. The song turned out to be an apt summary of Harrison’s music: a balanced blend of Western rock and Indian music.', 'Norwegian Woodis often considered to be the opening salvo of raga-rock, a musical fusion that flourished in the 1960s and 1970s. Harrison’s Indian compositions—Within You Without You,Love You Towith The Beatles—and his singleThe Inner Lightcontinued the trend. Early in his solo career, Harrison wrote songs like the folkyDehra Dunand the passionateBangla Desh,which recounts “his friend” Ravi Shankar approaching Harrison to help the victims of the 1970 cyclone in West Bengal and East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison was moved enough to singlehandedly organize rock music’s first charity show on a massive scale. The Concert for Bangladesh at New York’s Madison Square Garden in 1971 was a huge hit, helping Harrison raise millions for Unicef. His experience with India was immersive. To that effect, it might not be entirely surprising that the final strains of music ever recorded by Harrison was an over 2-minute section to end the album and song,Brainwashed, where Harrison and his son, Dhani, chant thebhajanNama Parvathi Pathaye Hara Harato Ghosh’s tabla. “Till the day I die,” Harrison is known to have toldRolling Stonemagazine in 1968, “I still believe (Indian music) is the greatest music ever on our level of existence.”', 'Indian classical music led Harrison towards Eastern spirituality and religion. He became a life-long adherent of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda. He helped London’s Radha Krishna Temple financially and also produced the singleHare Krishna Mantra. “One can say that of The Beatles it appears that only George ‘got’ India,” says Sally Grossman, wife of  the late Albert Grossman who managed the likes of Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, on email from her home in Woodstock, US. Other than vigorously pursuing a five-decade-old interest in thebaulmusic of Bengal, as is documented onBaularchive.com, a scholarly repository of her work and association with India, Sallyonce hosted George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd at their home. “They came to stay at our house so as to visit Bob Dylan. We bonded immediately over India. We all knew India had seduced us, entranced us, educated us and broadened our horizons,” writes Grossman. It was Boyd who introduced her husband and The Beatles to the Maharishi in 1967, which initiated the Fab Four into the Spiritual Regeneration Movement at Bangor in the UK.', '', 'The global yogi', 'By the time The Beatles came to Rishikesh in 1968, they were worn out by the strains and stress of fandom. It was already a couple of years since the Beatles had renounced touring, tired and stretched as they were by thousands of screaming teenaged fans at concerts, which often interrupted the actual performance. In director Martin Scorsese’s documentary filmGeorge Harrison: Living In The Material World(2011), there is a dramatic moment when Lennon stops an arena concert to look up at the shrieking girls interrupting the band’s performance. “Shut up,” he says firmly in the footage, “I’ll kill you.” Wild car chases by fans, stalking and the occasional threat of bodily harm were already part of the Beatles experience—clearly the band was at the end of their tether. India, and meditation, possibly, came as an escape hatch to the other side of celebrity.', 'Just prior to their arrival in Rishikesh, Brian Epstein, the band’s longtime manager, died. The Beatles were consoled by the Maharishi, who they had met just days before Epstein’s death, but were devastated nonetheless.', 'Then there was the issue of drugs. A couple of years back, the band had its first taste of the “notorious wonder drug LSD”, as Harrison put it the Scorsese film. Widening the mind’s perception and altering one’s consciousness through LSD was a key goal of the 1960s counterculture. It was no different for The Beatles. Even as he dropped acid near the door of a nightclub and took off on an “incredible” trip across time and space, Harrison was, by then, a student of Ravi Shankar. “I had this lingering thought that just stayed with me after that,” he says in the movie. “And this thought was the yogis of the Himalayas. I had never thought about them...but suddenly this thought was in the back of my consciousness. It was like somebody was whispering to me, you know. The yogis of the Himalayas.”', 'It was the Maharishi who impressed upon The Beatles to publicly renounce drugs at a press conference. “It was an experience we went through,” McCartney is quoted as saying at the press conference in Philip Norman’s biography,Shout!: The True Story Of The Beatles(2004). “Now it’s over. We don’t need it any more. We think we’re finding new ways of getting there.” At that juncture, it would have seemed that all roads, literally, spiritually and metaphorically, converged to get The Beatles down to Rishikesh.', 'The global media followed the band till the barred ashram gate for it ticked the boxes of “exoticism, Indian spiritualism, Ganges, Himalayas and the world’s most famous band,” says Saltzman. While the Beatles trip triggered the arrival of Indian spirituality and yogic practices in Western consciousness with the sprouting of street corner yoga and meditation studios, the personality of the Maharishi, who had harped on the need for Transcendental Meditation to the Beatles, saw McCartney penning a ditty likeThe Fool On The Hillin 1967 for the band’sMagical Mystery Touralbum. On the other hand, Lennon went on to write the wrySexy Sadie, an acerbic comment on the Maharishi (Sexy Sadie, what have you done/ You made a fool of everyone) and how ignominiously the Rishikesh visit ended for the band when there were allegations of sexual misdemeanour against the Maharishi.', 'Though the allegations were never really proved, the infamy stuck, says Anand Shrivastava, nephew of the Maharishi. Shrivastava is also the vice-president of the New Delhi-headquartered Spiritual Regeneration Movement (SRM) Foundation of India. “I don’t know what led John Lennon to make the allegation, for the Maharishi was abal brahmachariwho led a pure life. Maybe Lennon was frustrated at something,” says Shrivastava, on the phone from the Netherlands, where the Maharishi died in 2008, aged 90.', '', 'The cultural moment', 'The Maharishi’s Uttarakhand ashram was closed down by the state’s forest department in 1990 after its lease expired. It remained shut for 15 years and was opened to public only in 2015.', 'Seekers from the West continue to throng Rishikesh and the ashram, drawn by the prospect of attaining spiritual salvation and helped by The Beatles lore. Take, for instance, Tejasvi Giri who was earlier Deja Cross. An entrepreneur from the US who also helmed “multimillion dollar businesses”, she “renounced everything” and came to Rishikesh. She was an eight-year-old growing up in California when she heard about The Beatles’ tryst with the Maharishi and Indian mysticism, “another way of living that was difficult to fathom in a country where, back then, there was no culture of meditation,” she says.', 'Today, Giri, 58, is the founder-director of the Rishikesh International Film Festival, which in its second year is organizing a two-day event at the ashram to commemorate the 50th year of The Beatles’ visit. Beginning 16 March, the commemoration will see displays of photographs, presentations with slide shows, playing of songs and videos, Transcendental Meditation practice by schoolchildren, a ticketed tour of the ashram and a panel discussion centred around consciousness and creativity, among other events. Giri, who has been based in a village outside the touristy zones of Rishikesh, “living close to the people”, says, “I’ll be here only to be with the people.”', 'Ever since he first visited India and sought the curative powers of meditation at the ashram to overcome an estranged relationship, Saltzman, by his own reckoning, has been to India over 50 times. It wasn’t easy for him to gain access to the ashram, where the Beatles along with other musicians like Donovan and Mike Love of the Beach Boys were staying.', 'For the one week he was there, Saltzman slept in a tent pitched outside the ashram’s tall periphery wall but was permitted to participate in the ashram’s activities during the day. The meditation exercises gave Saltzman an insight into his own mind and soul; his intimate and candid photos of The Beatles gave the world a sneak peek into the bare and unvarnished side of celebrity lives. “The 50th anniversary is culturally significant because it marks one of the few times famous celebrities, who were artistically and commercially successful, put their careers on pause to study and investigate a spiritual discipline for their personal enlightenment,” explains Unterberger. “They did this even knowing they would be ridiculed by much of the media. If their fans were unlikely to ridicule, many were puzzled. It also marked one of the first times that Western pop stars committed to spending time experiencing a non-Western practice and culture that was very different from what they had grown up with and that made their superstardom possible.”', 'This year, coinciding with the India release of the special 50th anniversary edition of his photobook,The Beatles In India, by Simon & Schuster,  Saltzman will be back in India to complete the filming of his “Beatles film”, one which will bring in the elements of creativity, meditation, spirituality and love pivoted around Saltzman’s stories from 1968.', '', 'And in the end', 'The Rishikesh stint was possibly the first time in many years that Lennon and McCartney were staying next door to each other. This lead to an burst of creative camaraderie, says Miti Adhikari, who used to be the chief sound engineer at the BBC’s Maida Vale Studios in London.', 'Yet, despite the bonhomie, described by Norman as “the group mind”, Rishikesh, it can be argued, could well have widened the already-existing cracks of disagreement between the band members.', 'An indication to that effect can be found in Lennon’s songIndia, India, one of  two India-specific songs that he wrote in 1980, about his 1968 sojourn. In it, he sings:I’m waiting by the river, but somewhere in my mind, I left my heart in England, with the girl I left behind.This was Yoko Ono, the Japanese avant-garde performance artist he had befriended in 1966. Lennon had travelled with his wife Cynthia to Rishikesh but would sneak out every once in a while to the local post office to collect the postcards that Ono would send him. These would usually consist of one word, “Breathe”, Norman mentioned to an amused audience at a session on The Beatles in India held at the Jaipur Literature Festival in 2017.', 'Within a year of returning from Rishikesh, Lennon would divorce Cynthia and get together with Yoko Ono. Ono became a fixture at the studio sessions when The Beatles started recording the songs they had composed in Rishikesh for theWhite Album.', 'Lennon’s Rishikesh songs cropped up again on The Beatles’ final record,Abbey Road, in 1969.Mean Mr. MustardandPolythene Pamwere fragments which he later disparaged as “a bit of crap I wrote in India”. The Beatles would disband in 1970.', 'Whichever way you look at it, the ashram in Rishikesh remains a cultural signpost. Fifty years later, the weather-beaten, moss-covered and mouldy walls stand as mute witness to one of the most iconic moments in popular culture.', 'Also Read:', 'Beatles in India: A new life for John Lennon', 'A (far from) comprehensive list of Beatles covers', 'My sweet lords', '50 years of Beatles in India: How George Harrison brought Indian classical music to Western pop', 'If you are a Beatles fan, here’s the book for you', '']"

It became what is known as theGrey Album. The reception to that mash-up was mixed. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, the two surviving members of The Beatles, as well as Jay-Z, gave their nod of approval; listeners who heard it as it spread across the internet loved it; but EMI, the music company that published The Beatles’ record, was so enraged that it opposed the distribution of the album.', '', 'Danger Mouse’s project was probably the most innovative tribute to The Beatles whose songs, produced during a 10-year period (1960-1970), have inspired and been covered by other musicians more than any other band’s in popular music. Beatles’ songs have been adopted, adapted, and recreated by bands and artists across every genre you can think of—folk, blues, rock, bluegrass, reggae, jazz, punk, heavy metal, and even classical music. Many of those versions became hugely popular and some musicians attained fame on the backs of their covers of The Beatles’ songs, becoming known more for those than their own repertoire such as the English singer, Joe Cocker, whose version ofWith A Little Help From My Friends, especially the brilliant live version at Woodstock in 1969, has become immortal.', '', 'Covers by other musicians of Beatles songs run into hundreds, if not thousands but here’s First Beat’s list of covers—some popular; others not so well-known; but all of them a way of re-visiting a band with whose repertoire every fan of popular music is most familiar with. So, here goes, in no particular order, a list of Beatles covers you ought not to miss (disclaimer: it absolutely is not comprehensive!).', 'The Rolling Stones:The Stones were the arch rivals of The Beatles. But in 1963, they released the John Lennon-McCartney song,I Wanna Be Your Man, three weeks before it would feature on a Beatles album. The Stones borrowed the song from The Beatles for their second 45 rpm in the UK and their version is deliciously raw and much, much grittier (don’t miss the late Brian Jones’ striking slide lead guitar riff) than The Beatles’ own version.', 'Jaco Pastorius:Jazz bassist Pastorius was a mad genius and troubled soul who died tragically at 35. His 1981 album,Word Of Mouth, featuresBlackbirdfrom the Beatles’White Album. It’s an instrumental jazz version of the song on which Pastorius’ fretless bass and Belgian-American musician Toots Thielemans’ harmonica conjure up pure magic.', 'Elliott Smith:A singer-songwriter who was gifted with exquisite whispery vocals, Smith, like Pastorius, died young when he was stabbed in his chest in 2003. He covered many Beatles’ songs but his version ofBecausefrom their album,Abbey Road, is something else.Becausewas recorded by The Beatles with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison singing in harmony in three versions that were mixed to get nine voices but Smith, singing solo, accompanied by not much more than an acoustic guitar, makes that delicate song impossibly tender.', 'Nina Simone:With just her piano, and some percussion, the feisty Simone sings George Harrison’sHere Comes The Sunon her 1971 album of the same name. That album had eight songs, all covers, including Bob Dylan’sJust Like A Woman, butHere Comes The Sunis the one that truly stands out. It’s essential for everybody’s playlist.', 'David Bowie:It may have been credited to Lennon-McCartney, butAcross The Universewas actually written by Lennon. Bowie recorded his cover in 1975 at New York’s Electric Ladyland Studio, shockingly (at least to some) infusing into that LSD-inspired, self-absorbed dreamy song, slashes of anger. Did Lennon mind? We don’t know but what we do know is that he (Lennon) played acoustic guitar on the Bowie track!', 'Vic Juris:Jazz enthusiasts may be familiar with the virtuosity of guitarist Juris. He has an expansive discography, both solo and as a sideman. His instrumental version of Harrison’sWhile My Guitar Gently Weepswith delightful improvisation is a rare cover of a much-covered song that Juris remarkably transforms into a jazz masterpiece.', 'Sonic Youth:Sitars, tabla and Harrison’s fondness for Indian music abound on the psychedelicWithin You Without YoufromSgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Bandbut Sonic Youth’s version (to be found on the 1988 multi-artist compilation,Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father), infuses post-punk grit into the song. Raspy guitar and bass lines replace the Indian instruments and when the drums kick in, you’re hooked.', 'Patti Smith:Strawberry Fields Forever, first released in 1967, has been covered by hundreds of musicians but Smith’s punk version of it, bereft of frills, is outstanding though underrated. Watch her singing it live at New York’s Bowery Ballroom in December 2010 on a video that is readily available on YouTube.', 'Jerry Garcia Band:Inspired by Prudence Farrow (Mia’s sister),Dear Prudence, which was written while The Beatles were at anashramin India, has been a favourite for many bands to cover.

However, viewing all 3,500 artefacts can be challenging. So here’s what you should be looking out for.', 'The remarkable building', 'What it lacks in height, the two-level Palladian structure makes up for in details. Look upwards to see a stencilled and stuccoed ceiling, where alternate squares sport a gold-bordered star of David, presumably a nod to David Sassoon, the Jewish philanthropist whose patronage helped found the museum. Supported by delicately winding, ornate Doric pillars, the expansive ceiling has thin arches along its length. The colourful, well-aged Minton tiles on the staircase and first floor point out its period of construction from their popularity in the mid-19th century.', '', 'Maps charting the early formation of Bombay', 'The city maps on the upper level tell the story of Bombay’s evolution from seven islands to an industrial city and port. Start with the exhibit titled Heptanesia, a Greek word meaning seven islands, as recorded in the writings of Ptolemy. It remains the first recorded name for the city in any written language. Follow this with Grose’s Plan Of Bombay, an 18th-century watercolour mapping the streets within Fort to scale, making it a thorough representation of the closed city. Two large models of Worli by the City of Bombay Improvement Trust are displayed, laying out the topography of one of the original seven islands. One shows Worli before the establishment of mills, while the other shows houses, parks and grounds along with the first mills of the city, which brought in the first wave of migrant labourers.', 'The statuary', 'Located in a gardened path by the museum, the statuary offers more glimpses of early Bombay. Headless statues of Lord Marquis of Cornwallis and Wellesley are a curious sight—a result of the violence during the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement in the 1950s. The statues were later removed from their original locations in Fort and placed here. The pride of place, however, belongs to tall, rust-coloured lamp-post-fountain erected in the memory of Sir Seymour Fitzgerald, in 1867. That the statues of these distinguished men occupy a row facing stone plaques for civic amenities which they helped build must be its own form of irony.', 'JJ School of Art pottery exhibit', 'After the school of art was established in 1856, its superintendent installed a kiln for students to experiment with clay.

I haven’t seen the former (starring Brian Cox), but Wright’s film doesn’t suggest any compelling reason for its own existence, besides the suspicion that if British cinema was to fail to produce a certain number of period dramas in a year, it would spontaneously combust. I cannot imagine this film adding to anyone’s understanding of Churchill, nor does it push us to think of him as anything less than a walking embodiment of the spirit of wartime England. It’s a harmless film, perhaps even toothless, about a man who was neither.', 'Darkest Hourcovers the period from 9 May 1940, when Churchill (a transformed Gary Oldman) was appointed Prime Minister, to 28 May, on the eve of the evacuation of British soldiers from Dunkirk. At 66, Churchill has to deal with a hostile cabinet—including Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) and Lord Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup)—a suspicious king, George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), in addition to his own past failures in Gallipoli and India, while trying to check the advancing Nazi forces. It’s like Steven Spielberg’sLincoln, minus the diplomacy and with a lot more shouting from the central figure.', 'Using Churchill’s typist, Elizabeth Layton (Lily James), as a sort of audience proxy, the film treats Churchill’s drinking and near-constant bluster as adorable old-crank behaviour. There’s a musical comedy feel to the scenes where Churchill paces about with people trailing him which brings to mindThe King’s Speech, another film about British leaders during World War II.Darkest Hourgives a reasonable account of the pressures the premier was under at the time, but Wright’s showy long takes and the dramatic stagey-ness of several scenes kept pulling me out of the narrative.', 'The film nosedives in the final stretch, with an appallingly sentimental sequence in which Churchill rides the London Underground and asks commuters what they’d do if the Germans reach their shores. Why, we’d fight, they say, with our broomsticks if necessary. This, in the film’s telling, is what gave Churchill the courage to continue with the Dunkirk plan he’d outlined, which he was wavering about before he boarded the train.', 'Oldman’s Churchill is a terrific imitation, and will probably get him his first Oscar, though I’ll probably remember him as the sphinx inTinker Tailor Soldier Spyor the punk inSid and Nancy. As for Wright, I’d take the unbroken five-minute tracking shot along the beach at Dunkirk in hisAtonementover the rousing flatteries ofDarkest Hour.']"

Clear and simple presentation. My only doubt is, why couldn’t the government talk and bring in this chap since the beginning?” Isaac posted on Facebook, in Malayalam, later in the night after the meeting.', 'Mintreported on Thursday that Nilekani proposed to simplify the current process of complex return filing operations. Though a final decision is yet to be taken on the revamp of the return filing process, the GST Council is thinking of doing away with forms such as GSTR-2, dealing with purchases, and GSTR-3, a comprehensive return, the report said.', 'Instead, the existing simpler summary return form GSTR-3B will continue, which will be supplemented with details from invoices to be uploaded by suppliers on the GST Network (GSTN). This will enable invoice matching and check tax evasion.', '“Nilekani’s solution is a remarkably simple,” Isaac wrote, “Nobody has to file returns (as they are doing now). Instead every trader can send his sales invoice daily or weekly. Only if he upload and show the sales the one who bought from him will get the input credit. If he doesn’t upload, nobody will buy from him, since they won’t be getting any input credit from the purchase. In this manner, the computer itself will generate the return looking at the sales and purchase figures.”', '“I support Nilekani’s idea, but have asked for a week’s time to think since this will involve everything we have been saying and doing so far,” he said.', '“Only traders with more than Rs1.5 crore turnover has to file detailed returns currently. Kerala would have such 40,000 people. Almost half of them are using computer bills. For the rest, the government could give interest-free loans for computerization. It’ll make tax collection easier and curb leakage significantly,” added Isaac.', 'However, Isaac didn’t hide his displeasure with the center for coming up with the idea to make simpler the returns filing process, the foundation behind tax collection at states, only seven months after the GST rollout. “The returns are shrinking (affecting the state finance)... last month not even 60% filed returns,” he said.']"

Harrison, the youngest member of the band, proves a superb prism through which to view The Beatles and their absurdly meteoric rise. Scorsese shuffles through file footage, talking heads and photos—those lovely, endlessly watchable black and white photographs dripping with charm—in non-linear and relaxed fashion, fleshing out details we always thought we knew but never knew quite enough. The film is ostensibly about Harrison, but as he says to go with his cleverly conceived question, the Beatles become the Beatles only when all of them come together. The answer is always four.', 'When the band played in Hamburg—“the naughtiest city in the world”, says Harrison, who was 17 at the time—they camped in squalour, living behind the screen of a movie theatre that projected porn films, emerging only at night to shake things up with their unformed but unheralded sounds. Contrast this, if you will, with their first visit to the US, after they had conquered Britain and their queues outnumbered churchgoers. The year was 1964. John Lennon and Ringo Starr were 24, Paul McCartney was 22, George Harrison was 21 and these four boys had come to New York and been given an entire floor of the famed Plaza Hotel.', 'Naturally, they didn’t know what to do with it. The gang ended up huddled in one bathroom, bonded by intimacy and disbelief. It was a rare night of quiet in a surreal life where these young geniuses shaved on aeroplanes and slept under flashbulbs. There is an exquisite shot of McCartney, cherub-faced and irresistible, shushing the crowd in order to talk to them. The shrieks are endless and shrill and full of love of unprecedented decibels, and here’s McCartney, finger on his lips, trying to contain the uncontainable. “The Beatles had one day off a month,” chuckles Ringo Starr, recalling a pithy quote of the time, “and on that day Paul would judge a beauty pageant.”', 'Weddings in Liverpool are known for drunken hooliganism and punch-ups. Our boys started out playing at Harrison’s brother’s wedding, and they had their work cut out. There was a local piano player playing rousing renditions of popular songs, getting the crowd to sing lustily along and enjoy much off-key merriment, and this would normally be a tough act to follow. Except for Lennon, who came up behind the boisterous pianist and poured a pint of beer on her head while saying “I anoint thee, David”. The scene was so utterly impossible that the piano player gamely walked off and dried herself while the boys stormed the stage and started playing. No fight broke out.', 'The documentary uses music and interviewees anachronistically, playing Harrison’s 1970 songBeware Of Darkness—with the gorgeous linebeware of falling swingers—alongside pictures of the boys at their youngest, raw and rebellious and easily, wilfully enchanted by artistic girls who wore leather. The film opens with Eric Clapton (who once stole Harrison’s wife), moves on to Terry Gilliam (who directed Monty Python films produced by Harrison) and cuts to Harrison’s son Dhani, who looks uncannily like his father in the clip, and says that if he’d see his father today, he’d ask, simply, “Where have you been?”', 'The George Harrison smirk is a wondrous thing, daring both the person behind the camera and the one seeing the photograph to guess what he’s thinking. He has the secret, and it is ours but to wonder why. Scorsese lovingly tries to wheedle his way towards the truth in this film, and over the film’s 208-minute running time, he manages to find some answers while gaining several new questions. Harrison was the cool Beatle, the one who found equanimity and calm, and while all things must indeed pass, some mysteries need always remain.', '“Krishna, Krishna, Krishna” are the first things we hear Harrison actually say in the film, as he signs a contract after being herded into a room, signing his name warily and hurriedly. “May the lord help this to become final.”', '“He had a great haircut,” says McCartney about Harrison , eyebrows raised. “He had this long hair that he coiffed back...a great big marvellous thing.” This is true, and photographs of an early Harrison show a young boy with mad hair. It is enormous, angry, Johnny Bravo meets Johnny Cash hair, tall and upright like the former but curled back like the latter, and over the years—through mop-tops and maturity—it turned into a simple, sleek mane, a fine accompaniment to his moustache. It is quite the pleasure to watch older Harrison laugh at clips of younger Harrison, and even better to have him sing along.', 'One of the most brilliant things about The Beatles is the way they magnificently completed each other’s jokes. One would say something clever, the other would immediately and impulsively take it to another level, and the laugh would be rendered unforgettable. They were meant to click together, and as we have all seen them come up with zingers and break into appreciative laughs at one another at press conferences, it’s no surprise that Scorsese’s film is the same. At one point, McCartney describes the “pre-fame” days as Dickensian. “It was a Dickensian time. School was very Dickensian,” he says, thoughtfully. “It was an old, old place. In fact, Dickens had taught there... That’s how Dickensian it was.”', 'It is a film about Harrison, but McCartney steals it. That’s what they mean by getting by with a little help from your friends.', 'Stream Of Stories is a column on what to watch online.', 'He tweets at @rajasen']"

He’s betting on a good year for local-currency bonds.', 'If you don’t count China, emerging countries are running a trade surplus of about $4 billion to $5 billion a month, McNamara said. “Historically, if you put money into EM currencies in that situation you will make decent money,” he said.Bloomberg']"

Thirty of them, in fact. Of these, 13 are by John Lennon, and 12 by Paul McCartney. That’s enough songs for each of them to have produced solo albums that year. And in a way, that’s what their music on the album is—songs by John Lennon and The Beatles; songs by Paul McCartney and The Beatles. After five years and eight albums of unified statements, theWhite Albumwas about individuals.', 'It also marked Lennon’s creative peak, where he reasserted his primacy within the band, with striking and diverse songs that would go on to influence generations of songwriters. These were born of the enforced LSD-free detox of Rishikesh and the resulting drive and energy that he discovered. After two years of “gobbling acid”, as he put it, when he took LSD evangelist Timothy Leary’s advise to heart and surrendered his ego, Lennon was feeling recharged and competitive. He and McCartney were again composing songs “eyeball to eyeball” in Rishikesh, much as they used to earlier, and after months of drift following the death of the band’s manager, Brian Epstein, Lennon was ready to re-engage.', 'The songs started pouring out of him:Revolutionwas written in Rishikesh even as Europe and the US were convulsed with student protests and race riots. “I wanted to put out what I felt about revolution,” he said to Jann Wenner ofRolling Stonein 1970, “I had been thinking about it up in the hills in India.” A dedicated hippie, he had mixed feelings about the use of violence, to the extent that The Beatles recorded two distinct versions of the song. In the harder, fasterRevolution, Lennon proclaims,“When you talk about destruction, don’t you know that you can count me out”. However, he also realized that the establishment would never give the protestors what they wanted if they only asked nicely. So, in the slower, brassyRevolution 1, he sings “...don’t you know that you can count me out/in”. It was also the first song recorded for the album in end-May.', 'Dear Prudence, another gem written in Rishikesh, saw Lennon turning to one of his perennial muses, childhood. The song’s genesis lay in him singing to Prudence Farrow, the actress Mia’s sister, to persuade her to come out of one of her long, meditative trances. But the song’s sunny D major key, the optimistic, circular finger-picked melody and child-like wonder of lyrics like“the wind is low, the birds will sing, and you are part of everything”, point to the regeneration that he felt in himself.', 'But Lennon’s childhood was also one of absent parents and trauma, so when he went down that route withCry Baby Cry, what emerged was a dark and surreal take on the nursery rhymeSing A Song Of Sixpence. Mixed with imagery from his favourite book,Alice In Wonderland, the song’s subconscious probing of a dreamlike looking-glass world was made more eerie by a soundscape of droning harmoniums, dirge-like piano figures and bubbling sound effects. It was, also, extremely melodic and catchy, which only added to its weirdness. Songs like this would go on to create a separate sub-genre: art rock.', 'One of the reasons for Lennon’s creativity was also Yoko Ono, the avant-garde artist and musician he started dating on his return from India. They had met in 1966, and for much of 1967 had soft-shoed around each other, sizing each other up. Seven years older than Lennon, she was from a very different milieu than The Beatles, one of hip New York guerrilla art happenings, Marcel Duchamp and Philip Glass. A member of the radical interdisciplinary art group Fluxus, to her The Beatles were strange creatures. To Lennon, she gave off the same creative charge that he got from McCartney. Their physical desire for each other was equally fuelled by an intellectual one to impress and collaborate. Once the two became an item in the summer of 1968, Lennon became increasingly prolific. They collaborated on an album of experimental music,Unfinished Music: Two Virgins. They also collaborated, along with Harrison, on the avant-garde sound-collageRevolution 9for theWhite Album.', 'Lennon’s gorgeous meditation on his mother and idol,Julia, is a clear passing of the baton from one mother figure and muse to another.“Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it just to reach you, Julia”, sings Lennon, echoing a Khalil Gibran poem. Exorcising a decade of hurt and regret since his mother’s death in 1958, he introduces her to “ocean child”, the English translation of the Japanese word Yoko, in the song.', 'But all wasn’t rosy. The two had also started using heroin heavily that summer, as an escape from the stress of the racist abuse that Ono faced from the British public, and also that of The Beatles drifting apart, and their floundering multimedia empire, Apple. Two other stand-outs from Lennon,Happiness Is A Warm GunandEverybody’s Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkeyare clearly about this, but in a typically allusive Lennon way.Happiness..., a title taken from a gun magazine, is also deeply erotic and arty, shape shifting from finger-picked folk via a hybrid-talking blues to doo-wop.', 'Finally there is the neurotic fury ofI’m So Tired, another Rishikesh-origin song. Racked with insomnia and longing for Ono, Lennon howls, “You know I’d give you everything I’ve got for a little peace of mind,” even as The Beatles play a sombre robotic waltz around his vocals.

But for the six billion people of this planet who happen not to be Indian, the three seemed to magically appear together in a moment of celestial, psychedelic epiphany in the 1960s. This reading is rubbish, of course, but perceptions have a way of edging out facts.', 'There are many more players in the sequence of events that was to culminate with Indian classical music bursting on to the world stage with Western pop: the “quiet Beatle” George Harrison, American folk rocker David Crosby (of The Byrds and, later, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young), the musicians of the Asian Music Circuit in the UK and what Harrison would no doubt call destiny.', 'Harrison’s interest in Indian music began accidentally, in April 1965, on the sets of The Beatles’ filmHelp!, which had a sequence filmed in an Indian restaurant in London with Indian musicians playing Indian instruments, including a sitar. “George was looking at them,” according to John Lennon in the documentaryThe Beatles Anthology. The film’s music composer, Ken Thorne, used an Indian ensemble of sitar, flute, tabla,ghunghroo, tanpura and possibly a dilruba and surbahar to play a Beatles medley calledAnother Hard Day’s Night. The piece was not particularly well played, but it was appropriate to the occasion. And it got Harrison interested in the sitar.', 'The instrument—synonymous with Indian classical music—made its second appearance for The Beatles withNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), a Lennon-McCartney song that features in theRubber Soulalbum. Just using the sitar immediately lends this wistful tune an Indian feel and depth that seems not a bit out of place. The album was released in December 1965 andNorwegian Woodwas to become, quite possibly, the first Western pop song with the sitar in it.', 'How it happened is a story of cultural cross-fertilization of the kind that was rare back in 1965.', 'Lennon started writing the song in January-February of that year, according to Ian Macdonald’sRevolution In The Head.', 'On 15 August 1965, The Beatles began a tour of the US at the height of Beatlemania. By the time they had begun the tour, Harrison had already received a full introduction to the music and sitar playing of Ravi Shankar, courtesy of Crosby during a UK tour of The Byrds in early August, 1965. Crosby and legendary Byrds guitarist Roger McGuinn had been listening to Ravi Shankar back in the US. Recounting the interaction at the age of 75, at a concert in New Jersey in May 2017, Crosby said he had a Ravi Shankar album in his suitcase and he gave it to Harrison, which, “had… repercussions”.', '“He liked it, he liked it a lot. So then he went to India and in India he ran into a teacher, a guru, that he liked a lot.” This, of course, was Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Crosby, however, wanted to advise caution—“because I’m a little cynical”. The outcome was a song calledLaughing,the outstanding cautionary tale in his first solo album,If I Could Only Remember My Name.', 'If the intention was to moderate Harrison’s enthusiasm, Crosby had failed. Indian spiritualism and music were like a magnet for Harrison and their involvement in his own music abated not one bit post The Beatles.', 'His exposure to Indian instruments on the sets ofHelp!sparked off a lifelong passion for Indian music, as well as a close friendship with Ravi Shankar, who considered the Beatle his younger brother. AfterHelp!and the US tour, Harrison bought a sitar from a shop on Oxford Street in London in September and it may have been this instrument that we hear him playing onNorwegian Wood, although not with any elegance. The song was recorded in October 1965, which wouldn’t have given Harrison much time to practise. But he had certainly created a bit of music history.', 'One of the first to pick up the sitar afterNorwegian Woodwas Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones in the band’s furious rock paean to depression,Paint It Black, which is now associated with a generation’s disenchantment with materialism and war. The song was released in May 1966, a month after The Beatles recorded Harrison’sLove You To, his first ‘Indian’, for their albumRevolver.', 'The song follows a Hindustani classical structure—a slowalaapintroduction, followed by the main tune(gat)inmadhya layaor a middling tempo and ending with ajhala-like quick-tempo fadeout on the sitar. The song is without doubt a path-breaker in its uncompromising adherence to a form of music that was alien to Western pop.', 'The sitar played on the track is wonderfully confident and accomplished but views differ on who played the instrument. Peter Lavezzolli, in his bookThe Dawn Of Indian Music In The West, thinks it’s Harrison, but MacDonald writes, “For the recording, players form the North London Asian Music Circle were hired, including an uncredited sitarist who played most of what was once attributed to Harrison.” Most certainly, the playing is of a standard that an untutored musician—even a talented one like Harrison—would have found hard to produce. The tabla was played by Anil Bhagwat.', '', 'An Indian Summer now lit up the Swinging Sixties. The song was recorded in April 1966 and two months later Harrison finally got to meet Ravi Shankar. The Indian, already a legend, was in Bath for a performance with the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. They met: Ravi Shankar was decidedly undecided about Harrison, who may have been just another long-haired pop musician in the eyes of the Indian. “It is strange to see pop musicians with sitars. I was confused at first. It had so little to do with our classical music. When George Harrison came to me, I didn’t know what to think,” says Ravi Shankar inRaga, a 1971 documentary about the sitarist. “But I found he really wanted to learn. I never thought our meeting would cause such an explosion, that Indian music would suddenly appear on the pop scene.”', 'Harrison now started taking lessons from Ravi Shankar, which led to the flowering  of an extraordinary period of musical collaboration between The Beatles (Lennon too was an ardent admirer of Indian music—just listen toTomorrow Never KnowsorAcross The Universe) and Indian classical music. The pinnacle of this beautiful partnership came with Harrison’s songWithin You Without Youin The Beatles’ most famous album, the iconicSgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.', '', 'Recorded over March and April 1967, Harrison wrote the song on a harmonium (which seemed so entirely appropriate by now) at the home of his bassist friend Klaus Voorman. Having received tuitions from Ravi Shankar, the Beatle played the sitar on this track—and gave a superb performance. The song itself is ambitiously Indian, cruising between the 4/4 of ateentaaland 5/4 of thejhaptaal, with Indian musicians on the dilruba, swarmandal, tabla and tanpura, and an 11-member Western orchestra on violins and cellos.', 'As much as its music, the song stands out for its lyrics, a meditation on Indian philosophy—the refrain “And life flows on within youand without you” stresses the impermanence of life with its play on the word “without”. Trashed at the time by insular critics,Within You Without Youremains the most complete and accomplished piece of Indian music-inspired Western pop more than 50 years after the album’s release.', 'What then is the legacy of this extraordinary musical collaboration between The Beatles and Indian music? Quite possibly, there would have been no Ananda Shankar (Ravi Shankar’s nephew) playingJumpin’ Jack FlashandLight My Fireon the sitar on an album (Ananda Shankar) that became an underground dance classic in 1990s London. But individuals can only push history—not create it. Undoubtedly, Indian classical music would have reached and overwhelmed Western audiences with or without Ravi Shankar and Harrison, so extraordinary is its depth, power and richness. And as to the influence of The Beatles on Indian music, if you listen carefully you’ll find John, Paul, George and Ringo behind every rock-y Bollywood song you’ve ever heard or are likely to hear.']"

They had started in 2010, trying an offline model, so the transition to online was inevitable and seamless.', 'A number of developers have sensed similar opportunities, mostly across major cities, and launched a clutch of apps, in the process helping working people reconnect with their childhood passions or incorporate exercise in a crowded daily routine. These include GroundWala, Playo, Sportzify and Khel Now, which have been launched across Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Most have been launched in the past two-three years, offering everything from badminton and tennis to football and cricket, with working people in their 20s and 30s forming the main target group.', '“We find Zomato for food, TripAdvisor for travelling, IMDB for movies but nothing for sports,” says Ashish Negi, country head for Khel Now, which is trying to integrate football players, coaches and fans on a single platform. “Hence our idea was to create the same type of an ecosystem in the sports arena.”', 'The details might differ, but the rough idea is to bring back recreational sports into the daily routine. For the app developers, though, there were twin problems to tackle: one was space. There are sports clubs and gymkhanas everywhere, but many have restrictive annual memberships that are expensive and beyond the reach of most. The other, naturally, was finding a partner or a team.', 'The apps have sought to slice through these logistical hurdles by sorting out agreements with clubs that have pay-per-use slots or helping access derelict grounds or available school and college campuses after-hours. A small terrace could be converted into a play space, a 6,000 sq.m area suffices for the fast and furious five-a-side futsal, for instance. “There are some grounds we hadn’t even heard about,” says Vishwanath Reddy, 40, owner of a dental laboratory in Hyderabad who plays cricket every week now after using GroundWala. “Maybe we wouldn’t have been able to play otherwise.”', 'At GroundWala, research suggests there are 200 million urban men in India in the 20-45 age group, a vast pool for such apps to tap. Sports viewership is also increasing across India beyond cricket. “With things like the Fifa Under 17 World Cup (being hosted in India) or the success of Indian badminton, this has an impact on amateur players,” says Ankur Singh, 36, founder of GroundWala, which is  available in Hyderabad, Pune and Delhi. “When you watch a sport, you also want to play it.”', 'An interested amateur simply needs to log on to find other players or grounds. Many of these apps have other value-added options, such as providing equipment, hosting monthly tournaments and local leagues, in addition to maintaining a regular player base. “We just want people to start playing again,” says Vikash Singh, chief executive officer of Sportzify. “And what if we can make that accessible?”', 'Since the 1990s, going to the gym has become the primary fitness routine for city people and more formalized sports have lost ground significantly. “We aren’t saying the gym is not important,” says Daanish Suhail, the Bengaluru-based co-founder of Playo. “But we want people to realize that sports can be a fitness routine and a social option. It’s a great way to meet people.”', 'When Gurugram-based Abhishek Arora, 23, started playing football a month ago through GoSporto, it introduced him to a wider circle and brought some excitement into his exercise routine. He had been to the gym only twice during his six-month membership period. “Gym was too boring,” says Arora, who works in social media marketing. “But this is something to look forward to after office.”', 'After every game, players can rate other players on GoSporto. Similarly, Sportzify allows for post-match performance analysis based on your data, which means players are also being pushed to sharpen their skills. “What if people are looking to improve their game?” asks Vikash Singh. “We need to engage with people on the ground as well (not just online).”', 'Currently, women represent a minority on such platforms, comprising between 20-35% of users, say developers, although in some sports such as badminton, they are present in larger numbers. Still, broadly speaking, the amateur sports industry in the country is in its nascent stage. “It won’t grow in percentages but in multiples,” says Ankur Singh of GroundWala. “This particular industry is at a tipping point.”']"

Sometimes, he uploads a short video of himself playing on Instagram. Not long before he joined Saavn in 2008, spearheading its journey to become one of the leading music apps in India, he would jam with country musicians in Nashville, the “music town” of Tennessee, US, where he was born. He grew up listening to Led Zeppelin and Miles Davis, while still remaining true to his roots, humming to the songs of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Lata Mangeshkar and Pankaj Udhas, thanks to his India-born parents. “My inflections are a bit Indian sometimes,” he says as he plays an Instagram video of him playing a blues tune.', 'The digital music industry—downloads and streams—is estimated to be generating more than 70% of the over Rs12 billion music industry’s overall revenue in India, according to the 2017 “Indian Media And Entertainment Industry Report” by KPMG India and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). And with its 22-million subscriber base, New York-based Saavn is an important player in the industry.', 'We are meeting at Saavn’s office in Mumbai’s Andheri East. The conversation is peppered with data, graphics and charts that Malhotra, 41, keeps plotting on the wall in the conference room where we are seated. Malhotra, who is sporting a light stubble, has a certain flamboyance about him; this quality might have to do with his experience as a musician and being a regular at talks at technology forums.', 'It was during one such event in 2008 that Saavn co-founders Vinodh Bhat and Paramdeep Singh approached Malhotra.  Founded in 2007 in New York, Saavn was a B2B company, digitizing Indian music and distributing them to American services such as iTunes, Hulu and Amazon. The business was at that time making $100,000 (around Rs63 lakh now) a month from just iTunes downloads, but the co-founders felt there was potential to do something bigger. Bhat and Singh were aware of Malhotra’s work for HBO, where he had “helped define cross-platform content engagement and marketing”. He had expertise on things such as time-shifted streaming—the recording of live TV programmes for later viewing.', 'Malhotra was also looking to leave HBO, where he was vice-president, and start his own venture. “The three of us would meet every month over post-work drinks and discuss how we could transform Saavn from a music aggregator into a music platform for a wholesome consumer experience,” says Malhotra. “The conversations would also be about helping them think through video for Saavn.”', '', '*****', 'Malhotra could’ve been a professional musician. His father, though, had one suggestion: that he should least finish college before taking a career-related decision. He is a bachelor of science in biology from Washington University in St Louis but by the end of the term in 1998, he was sick of it. “I don’t like hospitals, I don’t like blood. I can’t be around it, I can’t be the best in this,” he remembers calling up his parents in Tennessee and telling them six months before graduation.', 'While in college, he had been thinking about a corporate job. Malhotra finished his credits a semester early and used that time to work as an intern at stock brokerage firm Smith Barney.', '“It’s not that I don’t love writing or playing music, but I also love building a business, working with people, leading teams,” he says. The internship led to a management consultant job at PwC in New York in 1998. For the next two years, he was working with companies, helping them manage their businesses and growth. Then he joined internet consultancy Proxicom.', 'One of his clients at Proxicom was HBO. They approached Malhotra to take charge of their new venture: HBO On Demand, one of America’s first video-on-demand services. Malhotra joined in 2004, which was his first step in the business side of entertainment. By the end of his four-and-a-half year tenure, HBO On Demand had become a $100 million property for the network. Some of the shows Malhotra worked closely on at HBO, includingThe Wire, have become the foundation stone for the current creative renaissance in television.', '“A big part of what we do here in Saavn,” he says, “the root comes from a lot of learnings from HBO. Both HBO and Netflix built a very big audience with licensed content first and then they built their brand with original content.”', 'When Malhotra joined Saavn, smartphones were just beginning to make their way into the market and Saavn was looking at a market where most people were still using traditional or pirated ways of listening to music. But there were a few more problems. “Indian music is fractured,” says Malhotra, “spread across different languages and music labels of different regions. So bringing it all together on one platform was complicated.” Some basics, seemingly unimportant but vital, needed to be fixed. Consumers looking for Indian songs would often misspell names of musicians or songs. Many, as it was found, would be looking for songs with the name of the actor who featured in it—a quintessentially Indian thing to do, considering that most of our pop music is essentially film music.', '“We thought, why not build a service where you can search for anything, the song title, name of film, composer, actor and even if you misspell it, we should be able to serve you,” says Malhotra.', 'They started putting the name of actors, singers and others in the metadata. And now, even if one misspells the name of the singer or the composer, the app suggests the correct name.', 'They created a prototype for the app in 2010. Malhotra remembers handing the phone to his mother, asking her to search for any song. “She found a song she hadn’t heard in years, it made her emotional,” he says. Malhotra remembers calling Singh: “There’s some magic moment to that. We need to build this.”', '', '*****', 'Saavn.com was launched as a streaming service in 2010 with about 150,000 songs. The early numbers were small—20,000-30,000 a month. “But the engagement was extremely high and the product affinity was palpable. We could tell early on that this was going to change people’s lives,” says Malhotra. Today it has close to 36 million tracks in 15 languages.', 'In 2015, Saavn raised $100 million from venture capital firm Tiger Global Management Llc and other investors in a deal that valued the firm at $400 million. It has also got investments from Liberty Media, Wellington Capital Management, and individuals like former Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin.', 'In 2017, Saavn’s listening hours increased by 70%, according to the company, which currently has 22 million subscribers globally; the other major player in the music-streaming apps field in India is Gaana, which claimed to have 35 million registered users in 2016. One of the areas where Saavn has shown growth in terms of time spent on the app has been in English language music, which grew by 176% in 2017. Two years back, this would have been surprising as the perception was that Saavn had more to offer to the Bollywood fan.', 'Since 2016, Saavn has made a conscious effort in acquiring international and independent music. In February 2017, it launched Artist Originals, a platform through which it aims to promote independent musicians, with a track by Mumbai-based underground hip hop musician Naezy. Other artists such as the indie singer-songwriter Prateek Kuhad followed. It has featured, among others, electronic music producer Nucleya in its artist-in-residence programme, where he produced new music, hosted audio shows and curated playlists. The programme started in 2016, and has featured Raghu Dixit and Papon. Malhotra likes to think of Saavn as a music platform built for artists. They have started streaming live sessions, often conducted on the stage built at one end of the Saavn office in Mumbai. Malhotra has performed on that stage as well. “We run the company the way artists and musicians might do,” he says.', 'But Saavn’s success ultimately is powered by data—“Eating technology for breakfast, that’s the phrase,” Malhotra says. The company has a rich bank of data accumulated over seven years. Malhotra goes to the extent of describing Saavn as an “equal part data and music company. When we want to green light content, we look at what the audience is, what the demographics are. When you build a company from the onset... you have to listen to that data,” he says. Saavn’s knowledge of what the audience is more likely to consume has encouraged them to dream beyond music. Soon, from being a music-streaming app, it will expand to videos—the behind-the-scenes videos of their popular celebrity chat show podcast #NoFilterNeha, hosted by actor Neha Dhupia, is already underway. “We’ll become a bit of Netflix, a little bit of MTV…but we’ll be Saavn at the heart of it,” he says.', 'Headquartered in New York’s Park Avenue, Saavn caters not just to people in India, but the entire South Asian diaspora spread over the world. This reflects in its choice of artists as well: in August 2017,  Artist Originals produced the English-Punjabi numberBom Diggythat brought together Zack Knight, a British-Punjabi musician of Pakistani descent, and Jasmine Walia, a British TV personality and musician of Indian origin. The people who run it—Malhotra, Bhat and Singh—are all non-resident Indians (NRIs).', 'As we wrap up, Malhotra gets a message on his phone. Singh and Bhat are waiting for him for another meeting. But before I leave, he plays me an audio clip on his phone: his version ofTujhe Dekha TohfromDilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge(1995) on the guitar. It sounds like the perfect closing note of this NRI success story.']"

And it’s an American president insisting his country’s economic interests take precedence over gauzy visions of a more inter-connected world.', 'Trump comes to the World Economic Forum, set to kick off on 23 January, with a rap sheet in the eyes of the Davos true believers. In his first year in office, he’s withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal and the Paris Agreement on climate change. He’s threatened to renege on the Iran nuclear deal, a free-trade agreement with South Korea, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).', 'He wants to build walls (literally along the US-Mexican border), not tear them down, and has reportedly questioned why the US accepts immigrants from “shithole countries” like Haiti, El Salvador and African nations.', '“The threats to global trade integration should not be underestimated,” said Eswar Prasad, a former chief of the International Monetary Fund’s China division and now a professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “The Trump administration has fomented uncertainly in the rules of the game underpinning international trade.”', 'As America withdraws, China’s global influence is growing. Xi has dispatched his trade negotiators to help formulate a new Asian trade pact in the wake of TPP. China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, which calls for massive infrastructure investment and the development of new trade routes, is reshaping the terrain in the world’s most economically dynamic region.', 'Xi won’t be attending Davos this year, with his top adviser on the economy set to represent China’s interests. The Chinese president’s speech last year was seen as a rebuttal against the protectionist threats of Trump, who was then just days away from taking office after a campaign littered with threats to take on China over trade issues.', 'China of course is nobody’s idea of a free-market economy. It subsidizes rust-belt industries that are flooding global markets with steel, it shut down short-sellers during a stock market bust in 2015 and state-owned enterprises and banks still dominate the economic landscape. Yet Xi hasn’t blasted trading partners as brazenly as Trump, nor been so quick to threaten trade wars to pursue its economic agenda.', 'Trump’s blustery style and withdrawal from global commitments has given Xi an opportunity to recast himself as a defender of the existing order—even if it’s clearly on China’s terms.', 'Given all that, it’s probably not surprising that this year’s big-think theme at Davos is: “Creating a shared future in a fractured world.” Other world leaders expected to weigh in that debate include Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French president Emmanuel Macron.', 'Growth upswing', 'Despite the ripped-up trade agreements and kvetching over the lack of American leadership, the world economy is actually enjoying its first run of synchronized growth in years and stock markets are booming.', 'Global trade in goods and services surged in 2017 and the pace of growth is forecast by the IMF to have hit 4.2%, outstripping 2.4% in 2016.

A like-to-like comparison of the quarter’s performance with a year back is not meaningful, due to the recent acquisition of cement units from the Jaypee Group. But operating profit missed forecasts significantly in spite of a ramp-up in cement sales because of weak realizations and unanticipated cost hikes.', 'The Aditya Birla Group cement conglomerate’s stand-alone net sales catapulted by an impressive 33% to Rs7,471 crore. But this was driven by a 37% jump in volumes, thanks to the incremental capacity from its acquired units too. However, sales realization per unit of cement sold was not up to expectations. It was even lower than the September quarter by about 5% and flat on a year-on-year basis. This explains the weakness in cement prices. Besides, analysts say that the pan-India cement producer’s non-trade (large institutional) sales were substantially higher during the quarter, where prices are much lower than in the trade segment.', 'Further, it was a quarter of unanticipated cost hikes. The ban on use of petroleum coke by cement firms and the hike in import duty on it, after the ban was subsequently lifted, increased energy costs by 21% year-on-year. That apart, rise in diesel costs resulted in higher logistics expenses. These two components account for about two-thirds of the total operating costs, therefore taking a toll on operating performance.', 'The quarter’s operating margin (excluding other operating income) at 15.5% missedBloomberg’s estimate by a huge 350 basis points. According to Binod Kumar Modi, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd, the per tonne Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) at Rs717 was poor compared to Rs949 and Rs957, respectively, in the year-ago period and the September quarter.', 'This is not to say that there is gloom ahead. Clouds appear to be clearing up and the management, in the analysts’ conference call, painted an improving demand environment for cement. The infrastructure and low-cost housing push should augur well for the industry and for UltraTech, the country’s largest cement producer.', 'Although costs continue to rise, analysts reckon that the company has deftly steered through challenging times. Also, costs during the quarter could have been higher due to incremental maintenance cost of the newly acquired units, which will normalize as capacity utilization improves from the current 70% levels. Dealers say that the pan-India company has been pushing sales aggressively in new regions to gain market share.', 'The key to higher profits in the coming quarters therefore rests on cement prices that should support realizations along with higher sales volumes. Otherwise, the story of rising revenue and declining profits may continue as was the case in the December quarter, when the reported net profit at Rs422 crore was 25% lower year-on-year.', 'A ramp-up in utilization of capacities of its acquired units, along with improved realization, is important to support the stock price.']"

It should be noted though that the stock has surged more than 10% in the last three months on hopes that the September quarter was the worst.', 'The previous quarters showed that the lender had grossly miscalculated about its asset quality. The massive divergence in reported bad loans for fiscal year 2017 that the Reserve Bank of India’s scrutiny of the lender’s books revealed, damaged the trust investors had. A key question was whether Yes Bank is finally giving a true picture of its asset quality. The third quarter showed that the bank has indeed learnt its lesson and provided for all its past indiscretions.', 'Yes Bank did manage to keep a lid on fresh slippages. In the three months ended December, it labelled Rs494.9 crore worth of loans as bad.', 'Its strong advances growth of 46.5% gave a pleasing gloss to the bad loan ratios with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) falling to 1.72% of total loans from 1.82% in the September quarter. Net NPAs dropped to 0.93% of advances in the December quarter from 1.04% in the three months ended September.', 'That brings us to the second more important question. Has Yes Bank provided for every risk on asset quality?', 'The management has said that it has made adequate provisioning for all accounts referred under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to which it has an exposure of Rs1,342.4 crore. The fact that provisions are up a massive 265% from a year ago is proof of this.', 'Be that as it may, the private sector lender’s provision coverage ratio is a pitiful 46.4%. That means Yes Bank is exposed to future blows to asset quality. The lender has around Rs800 crore as restructured advances under various regulatory schemes in addition to the Rs1,342.4 crore under IBC.  A resolution where haircuts don’t go beyond 50% is essential for Yes Bank’s future profitability.', 'So while the private sector lender may have no hidden dirt under its carpet, it could do with a bit more insurance against future risk.']"

Earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) of the division fell 93% year-on-year to Rs167 crore. After accounting for finance costs, the unit ran up huge losses. Airtel’s net finance costs stood at Rs2,088 crore, and 60% of this is attributable to the India wireless business, according to analysts.', 'The losses in the flagship India wireless business suggests Airtel is willing to pay a large price—in the form of near-term losses—in fighting Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.', '“The key takeaway from the quarter’s earnings print is the increased willingness of incumbents to fight Reliance Jio hard in what is now a brutal fight for ‘LTE recharge’ market share; incumbents are gunning to regain some of their lost ‘LTE spend share’ and perhaps seeing some signs of success there. This is at the expense of ARPU (average revenue per user) dilution from a lot of existing customers, of course,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients. LTE stands for long-term evolution, the technology Reliance Jio and Airtel are using to offer 4G services.', 'Revenues of Airtel’s India wireless business fell 22.2% year-on-year and 12.2% sequentially to Rs10,751 crore. The decline can be attributed largely to the 57% cut in interconnection usage charge (IUC) by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) effective 1 October. According to numbers shared by the company, the IUC cut accounted for about 70% of the drop in revenues last quarter.', 'The fact that revenues fell at a higher pace compared to Street estimates suggests further downtrading by the company’s subscribers to lower Arpu levels. Arpu fell last quarter to Rs123 from Rs145 in the September quarter. Incumbents such as Airtel extended discounted bundled offers to its larger subscriber base only in the last quarter; earlier, most such schemes were available to subscribers who owned 4G compatible handsets. “Incumbents are displaying that they have fight in them; at the expense of Ebitda and cash flows for now,” Kotak’s analysts wrote to clients, supporting the company’s move to retain market share by lowering tariffs. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.', 'The upshot: the division’s reported profit was below even beaten-down expectations of analysts; and worse still, with rising capital expenditure, depreciation charges were higher than estimates.', 'The saving grace continues to be the company’s Africa operations, where Ebit rose by 3.5 times year-on-year.  While revenues in the region have been more or less flat, profit margins have improved on the back of the restructuring the company has undertaken. Margins of the Africa business were also aided by the deconsolidation of some low-margin operations last quarter.  Besides, the Airtel homes business and the enterprise business reported a sharp growth in profits, which is partly owing to one-off items, according to company officials.', 'In sum, Airtel results show that its fight with Jio has become uglier. How the latter responds to incumbents’ renewed aggression remains to be seen. For now, investors need to be prepared for continued pain.']"

Vishwanathan, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India on Thursday.', 'He also asked banks to improve underwriting standards by writing strong loan covenants—agreements with the borrowers—as well as enforcing them on time.', 'Indian banks are currently sitting on a stressed asset pool of over Rs10 trillion.', '“Risk-based pricing of loan would need fair assessment and understanding of the risk involved, rather than merely relying on collateral and/or guarantees obtained from stakeholders including equity holders. Banks should charge interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved in the projects that are being financed,” he said at an event.', 'In many instances, risk is under-priced, he said.', '“It would be safe to assume that had proper risk pricing been done by banks, many of the current NPAs (non-performing assets) could have properly assessed very well in advance,” he added.', 'According to Vishwanathan, risk-based pricing will help lenders build buffers that will act as cushions in case certain projects become non-performing assets. Such assessment must also be in sync with the stage of business cycle where the borrowers operate.', 'Enforcing loan covenants along with proper risk pricing and early recognition of stress must be embedded in credit culture of banks, he said.', 'Early recognition of stress has assumed even more significance under the resolution mechanism of Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). This is because the IBC has strict timelines for resolution; else, the asset is liquidated.', '“In IBC, the possibility of equity holders losing an entity should result in both stakeholders, creditors as well as debtor, to work towards resolution that is best for them. Both of them have an interest in keeping it in going concern. Therefore, coordination mechanisms among banks, through institutional platform like joint lenders’ forum (JLFs) must ideally deploy before the account is classified as special mention account (SMA),” he said.', 'RBI has mandated banks to form JLFs when the account is classified SMA-2.', 'When the principal or interest payment for a particular loan is overdue between 61 and 90 days (and not exceeding 90 days), this is called special mention account-2 or SMA-2.', '“Use of covenants in monitoring loan exposures can reduce stress and time to recovery. A covenant remains a simple, but an often ignored tool in the Indian context and could be used more effectively to avoid a repeat of the asset quality problems facing the Indian banking system,” said Udit Kariwala, senior analyst, financial institutions, at India Ratings.', 'According to India Ratings’ analysis of 83 stressed corporate borrowers with a debt of Rs5.1 trillion (classified as default by at least one rating agency by 31 May 2016), had banks restricted incremental debt to companies using the efficacy of covenants, the time to recovery from organic cash flows would have been half of the current levels of 19 to 24 years. In certain cases, the stress could have even been avoided.']"
