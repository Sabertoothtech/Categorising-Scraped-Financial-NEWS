"['U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that his long-awaited plan to help rebuild the nation\'s infrastructure would result in about $1.7 trillion in overall investment over the next 10 years, a larger figure than he previously announced.The plan, which will be detailed in part at next week\'s State of the Union address, will actually probably end up being about $1.7 trillion, Trump told a gathering of mayors at the White House. Trump previously valued the plan, which is expected to feature a mix of federal and local investment, at $1 trillion.The administration is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion in federal spending on infrastructure aimed at encouraging more than $1 trillion in state, local and private financing to build and repair the nation\'s bridges, highways, waterworks and other infrastructure.Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the big challenge ""would be how do you pay for it and the (Trump administration is) talking about spending cuts, which are unspecified.""related newsAlibaba, US grocer Kroger had early business development talks: SourceDonald Trump takes his \'America First\' policies to Davos \'globalists\'Qualcomm signs $2 billion sales MOUs with Lenovo, Xiaomi, vivo and OPPOThune said it was probably going to be ""tough"" to get Democrats to support a deal without the federal government raising additional revenue for improvements.He said in order to get a bill approved this year, it would need to be moving through both the House of Representatives and Senate by late spring or early summer. Trump will need to make a big push to win approval, Thune added.Reuters reported last week that the plan involved $100 billion in cost-sharing payments for projects and $50 billion for rural projects, with the remaining $50 billion largely split among ""transformative"" projects such as high-speed trains, and funds for federal transportation lending projects.A leaked document released this week, which an administration official confirmed was ""largely accurate,"" shows that the administration plans to reduce the cost-sharing for projects to no more than 20 percent of the costs from the traditional 80 percent federal share. That would result in a higher overall infrastructure boost if states agree to shoulder more of the costs.Democrats have criticized that proposal and argued the Trump administration should back more direct federal spending.The bill will also aim to streamline environmental reviews and it make it easier to build highways and other projects and allow for greater tolling on roadways.']","Union, Congress, Commerce, Committee, Reuters, newsAlibaba, MOUs, OPPOThune, Democrats, House, Representatives, Senate, Trump"
"['Apple Inc\'s move on Wednesday to give iPhone owners information about the health of their batteries reverses the company\'s longstanding refusal to make such information available directly on iPhones and iPads, even though battery health has long been easy to check on Apple\'s Mac computers.Apple said an update to its iOS operating system will show the phone\'s battery health and recommend whether the battery needs to be replaced. It will also let users turn off a controversial piece of software that slows the phone\'s performance in some situations when the battery is flagging.Apple acknowledged in December that its software sometimes deliberately slows phones with weak batteries. Apple apologised and lowered the price of battery replacements in its stores from $79 to $29 for affected phones.Critics say Apple has obfuscated the fact that a worn-out battery not only fails to hold a charge, it also degrades the phone\'s performance. The company\'s lack of transparency on the issue has pushed people to buy a new phone rather than a new battery, these people say.related newsAlibaba, US grocer Kroger had early business development talks: SourceDonald Trump takes his \'America First\' policies to Davos \'globalists\'Qualcomm signs $2 billion sales MOUs with Lenovo, Xiaomi, vivo and OPPO""The battery wears out,"" said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, which publishes repair guides for iPhones and sells replacement parts. ""They have been pretending like the battery doesn\'t wear out. They\'ve made billions of dollars on that pretense.""Apple has always banned battery-health apps from the App Store for security reasons. While a few developers had found ways around the restrictions, their apps stopped showing a key piece of information - the ""charge cycle count,"" or how many times the battery has been drained and recharged - after a 2016 software update.Rogerio Hirooka of Lirum Labs said his company\'s app lost charge cycle counts in 2016 but can still provide information on charge capacity, which can be used to determine whether the battery is at the end of its life. He said a routine bug-fix for the app was rejected by Apple in December, just before Apple acknowledged the battery-slowing issue.Apple rejected his app because it provides ""potentially inaccurate diagnostic functionality"" that could ""mislead or confuse your users,"" according to documents from the app review process seen by Reuters. Apple explains that ""there is no publicly available infrastructure to support iOS diagnostic analysis,"" according to the documents.Apple declined to comment on why battery diagnosis is available on the Mac but not on the iPhone, or why it rejected the update to Hirooka\'s app.""That fact that they tell you (battery health) on the Mac but it\'s a forbidden secret on the iPhone is crazy,"" Wiens said.All lithium ion batteries degrade over time. Until the software update announced Wednesday becomes available - and Apple has not given a specific date - the only way to check an iPhone battery is to take the device to an Apple Store or hook the phone up to a Mac computer running special third-party software.Repair advocates have long criticized Apple and other technology companies for making batteries hard for users to access and replace. Apple has been lobbying against ""right to repair"" laws in several U.S. states that would require it to sell parts to independent repair shops.']","iPhone, iPhones, iPads, Mac, iOS, MOUs, OPPO, iFixit, iPhones, App, Store, Reuters, iOS, iPhone, iPhone, iPhone, Mac"
