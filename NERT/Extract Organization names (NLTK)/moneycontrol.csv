Therefore, over 90 percent of employers, across small and large companies, give less importance to college degrees compared to proficiency in skills and experience.Around 88 percent of these developers, across all age groups, rely on forums such as Stack Overflow to learn new coding languages. “This is true across age groups. Indian developers value step-by-step advice from peers who came, saw, and conquered challenges before them,” Vivek Ravisankar, co-founder and CEO of HackerRank, said in the report.There is, however, a clear age group divide between YouTube and books as the second favourite resource for learning to code. “We are on the cusp of an evolution in coding education. The very nature of learning is changing. Younger generations are flocking to YouTube while older generations prefer books to learn new skills,” Ravisankar said.More specifically, when learning a new tool, 65 percent of millennials log onto YouTube while 85 percent of Gen X prefers book to learn new skills.Python gaining popularityMajority of Indian developers know C, Java and C++ with 43 percent developers saying that Python will be the next language they wish to learn.“Python is universally the most popular language and is most loved by Indian developers while Node.js is the most loved framework,” the report says.However, popularity of a language depends on generation divide. While millennials generally like JavaScript and dislike Go, the opposite is true among 45-54 year olds.Younger developers prefer newer frameworks like AngularJS and React, while older developers prefer Vue.js.Increasingly, companies are looking at GitHub and projects to supplement resumes and evaluate skills better. “When we filtered the data by roles, we found that those in a C-level position, including founders, CTOs and VPs, valued GitHub projects more than years of experience. Prestige of degree dropped even further in importance for these folks,” he said.On the other hand, developers prefer offbeat perks from stock options, in return of their service. In India, 65 percent people surveyed said professional growth and learning opportunities was an important factor in choosing a company, while 58 percent said it was work-life balance.The findings provide a roadmap for companies and hiring managers to improve the way they hire developers. While 77 percent of hiring managers in India primarily rely on resumes to evaluate developers at the first stage of the recruiting process, nearly all say assessing skills is the hardest part of the process. While, about half of developers say that resumes are not a good reflection of their abilities.“2018 will mark the end of the resume for developers. As more and more companies across all industries are hiring software engineers, it's more important than ever to truly take the time to understand who developers are, what they’re interested in, what drives them, and what they look for in a job. Without this, hiring managers will always struggle to find the best technical people,” he said.""]"

The renewable fuel is witnessing a major retail push from the government as it is desperate to reduce the high cost of imported fuel.The ministry of road transport and highways is urging automotive companies to introduce flex engines that can run with ethanol content as high as 100 percent. Automotive manufacturers have been selling E10 cars (10% ethanol, 90% petrol) in India but the government even struggled to meet E5 till 2016.“Flex engines are those which can run on 100 percent petrol and/or 100 percent ethanol. So we will see the launch of two bikes from two big companies by end of this month. Brazil, Canada and US already have the option of ethanol and buyers there have the option of choosing between petrol and ethanol. One tonne of rice straw can produce 280 litre of ethanol,"" said Gadkari.related newsAbout 50% of developers start coding before they turn 20: ReportBilateral APAs – India’s preferred method of dispute resolutionGadkari further said that as per a new policy, which was approved by the Cabinet, India could see an increase to the tune of 50 percent in production of ethanol.“We import Rs 7 lakh crore worth of fossil fuel. We have decided that we will make second generation ethanol from cotton stalk, wheat straw, bagasse and bamboo. Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan has been looking into this and made a policy and our Cabinet has approved it. This will result in 50 percent extra production of ethanol in India,"" added Gadkari.Early daysIndian two-wheeler manufacturers have tried their hand at CNG-fueled engines in the past but there was no major headway as the technology for gas-fired bikes has not evolved and availability of the fuel still remains a hurdle. Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company tested two-wheelers to run on CNG. There have been launches of CNG-powered scooters wherein the Activa of Honda was\xa0modified to run on CNG.Alongside ethanol, the government is also pursuing other alternative fuels such as bio-diesel and methanol. Gadkari is betting on methanol as fuel for commercial vehicles that can be blended with a fossil fuel or directly. In some countries, methanol is even being used in racing cars.Being a coal surplus country, production of methanol will not be an issue, believes Gadkari.“Methanol is Rs 22 per litre and emits much less harmful gases and there are compan+ies which make methanol from coal. We are coal surplus country. We can have trucks and other engines powered by methanol”, added Gadkari.']"

However, it may not be the best approach. “Investors should never pick investment schemes only on the basis of past performance. One should focus on hypothesis of the funds and how relevant they are in current market environment,” says Roopali Prabhu, Head of Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth management.Here are five schemes that are being recommended by wealth managers but not necessarily rank at the top of the performance charts.Axis Focussed 25 Fund: Compared to other equity offerings of Axis Mutual Fund, this is a relatively new offering and runs a concentratedportfolio. The scheme is managed by Jinesh Gopani. “The scheme offers to pick the best of the investment ideas of the fund manager. Though the portfolio is concentrated it has large cap bias and actively managed.

This has ensured that the fund has done well in the long term,” explains Nishant Agarwal, Managing Partner & Head - Family Office, ASK Wealth Advisors. The stocks are not cheap anymore and inclusion of such a scheme can help your portfolio to weather volatile times.Invesco India Contra Fund: The diversified offering by Invesco Mutual Fund is a decade old one. The scheme is managed by Amit Ganatra since August 2012. Taher Badshah started co-managing the scheme since January 2017. Ashish Shanker, head – private wealth investment advisory, Motilal Oswal Wealth Management recommends the scheme saying, “The fund employs value style of investing with a contrarian approach. The fund manager focusses on bottom up approach and does not shy away from taking significant deviation from benchmark.”The bottom up stock selection has led to significant outperformance to the benchmark.

Cautioning against any sale of assets of JIL and JAL, and against merger or de-merger, the Bench had said, “We are only concerned with the deposit of money and any such move (sale or merger, etc) will amount to contempt of court... if anyone does that, then Tihar (jail) is not far from here.”It directed JAL, holding firm of Jaypee Infratech (JIL), to provide details of its housing projects in the country, saying homebuyers should either get their houses or their money back.A Bench headed by CJI Dipak Misra, however, refused to accord urgent hearing on a plea of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seeking its nod to initiate insolvency proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal against JAL and said it would be dealt with at a later stage.“Lower middle-class homebuyers of JAL cannot be made to run from forum to forum. We want to protect homebuyers,” the Bench had said while refusing urgent hearing on the RBI’s plea.The Bench had asked Pawanshree Agrawal, appointed amicus curiae to assist it, to set up a second portal to take note of grievances of the homebuyers, and said the grievance portal be “kept alive”. Earlier, a similar portal was directed to be set up for the homebuyers of JILDuring the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi and lawyer Anupam Lal Das, appearing for JAL, said only eight percent of homebuyers have opted for refund of money and 92 percent wanted delivery of their homes.The court also considered the submission of senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing eight independent directors of JAL, that they were old and resided in different parts of the country and should be exempted from personal appearance but reiterated its earlier direction that neither would they leave the country without its prior nod, nor would they alienate or create third-party interests in their personal properties.At the last hearing on November 22, the Supreme Court had allowed the parent company of Jaypee Infratech Ltd to deposit Rs 275 crore on that day and another Rs 275 crore by December 31 (Rs 150 crore by December 13, 2017 and Rs 125 crore by December 31, 2017).No specific timeline was given to deposit the remaining Rs 1,450 crore.

The only indulgence is to pay the same in instalments.”This was against the earlier order asking the promoters to deposit Rs 2000 crore by November 13 which the promoters were unable to meet even after four deadlines expired.In November, the SC registry wanted the amount of Rs 275 crore deposited by the troubled Jaypee Associates to be transferred from the general account of the SC to a fixed deposit so that it could earn interest. The request has been accepted.The amicus curiae of the Jaypee insolvency case, Pawan Shri Aggarwal, was directed by the Supreme Court last month to update the portal where homebuyers who have booked apartments in various Jaypee projects in Noida could register their claims.On September 11 this year, SC directed Jaypee Associates, the parent firm of its real estate firm Jaypee Infratech, to deposit Rs 2,000 crore by October 27.

These include those involved in construction, cement, building material products, housing finance, FMCG, consumer durables, amongst others.While it gets difficult to comment on the probability of LTCG being introduced, we believe it should be low, especially considering that this asset class is not very significant in size (relative to other financial assets).Not to mention that the government has been promoting investment in equities for long-term wealth building, especially towards individual and retail investors in recent times.What could, however, be an alternative to this could be the extension of the timeline that defines LTCG (one year and beyond currently), which may not be a bad idea as it could promote long-term investment into equities.Q) Expectations are high from the government about likely some package for the agricultural sectors to boost rural income. What are your expectations from the Budget from agri sector and what stocks are likely to benefit the most?A) With the likelihood of the budget being pro-poor, there could be incentives going in the way of the rural economy, including a focus on job creation. Not to mention that the expectations for tax cuts and lower rates for individuals and corporate both are high as well.All of these will have a trickledown effect on consumption and will give a fillip to areas such as farm mechanization, fertilizer usage, auto consumption and NBFCs.These areas would get a further boost if the government allocates higher amounts towards crop insurance (given its importance) and a special focus on rolling out direct benefit transfer (given that it has helped curb the leakage in the system considerably) quicker.Q) Valuations of small and midcap stocks are already trading at a hefty premium. Do you see the party continuing in this space and what is the kind of strategy which investors should adopt?A) From a broad perspective, valuations concerns do remain. However, a bottom-up approach is warranted, as it makes sense for one to look at businesses with long runways of growth, strong balance sheets and good quality of earnings.Stocks of companies having such traits will do well over longer periods as they would benefit from the power of compounding.Having said that, it would make sense for investors to exit stocks where the valuations are high and fundamentals are poor, as over the long term such a combination has rarely led to good investment results.Q) Brent has already touched $70/bbl. What could be the repercussion for the market as well as for the economy?A) We think the markets have already priced this in. As long as crude remains within this range, there should not be any material impact on the market.Q) What will be your advice to investors for the year 2018 after a blockbuster rally seen in the year 2017?A) While long-term trend for the markets continues to remain positive, valuations does look stretched at current levels especially in certain pockets. Therefore, it would be prudent to keep booking profits but to keep the principal invested in the markets.Q) What are your contrarian bets which hold potential to bounce back in the next 2-3 years?A) Within the beaten down sectors, or the underperforming sectors – i.e. IT and pharma – there are select names that one can look at. The domestic plays in the pharma space and the midcap IT plays (with focus on products) would be good areas to look at.Another sector where one could see a lot of traction in the coming years is power. That is an area where major reforms are expected in the coming years. Therefore select names in the power sector could also be considered from a long-term perspective.']"

Hardik Pandya’s brother scored 243 runs at an average of 34.71 in the last edition and also took two wickets. It is highly likely that Mumbai Indians will use the right to match option for him.Prithvi Shaw– Although Shaw was unsold in the previous auction, few will bet on a repeat of a similar result this weekend.

He is also an off-spinner and was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for an astounding Rs 4.2 crore in 2016. Having played 41 matches, the Baroda man is an experienced customer in this tournament.Kamlesh Nagarkoti– This teenage tearaway has generated quite a buzz in the ongoing U-19 World Cup with his speed and as fast bowlers are always in high demand in the T20 format, it won’t be a surprise if franchises go all out for him in the auction. There’s a good chance that Rajasthan Royals will go for him in the auction as he will also give the team a local connect.Rajneesh Gurbani– The find of the Ranji season, Rajneesh was one of the main reasons behind Vidarbha's fairytale run. He finished the season as the second-highest wicket-taker with 39 wickets. A proven swing bowler in Indian conditions would appeal to many franchises and having tasted blood with Vidarbha, his winning mentality will also help him settle down quickly in the slam bang format.""]"

They were taught to be at home and make peace with the fact that the breadwinner will always be the man in her family. In all stages of her life, she is, by default, under control of first her father and brothers and then, her husband.But writers like Woolf had the gut to question the society \'norms\' - the norms which had already decided a girl\'s fate in her life. The norms, so to say, pointed that women will not be allowed to work and even in most cases, pursue education.In her non-fiction book,A Room\'s of One\'s Own,written in 1929,\xa0she writes, ""A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."" The quote directly points to how a woman who is chained to the societal norms urges to break open and live independently.\xa0 The writer dared the society by saying that even though a woman was obliged to follow the norms, in her book, she writes, ""Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.""related newsNews in Pics: Your daily dose of pictures from around the worldPadmaavat controversy LIVE: 18 arrested in Gurugram school bus attack caseSupreme Court to hear plea against 4 states, Karni Sena for violence over \'Padmaavat\'Her belief in the oppressive nature of the society on women, did not stop with just one book.

Woolf was known to give a human and personal touch in her writings, which is the main reason why she is being remembered today by Google.The writer, however, suffered from depression. At the age of 59, the writer is believed to have committed suicide by filling up stones in the pockets of her clothing and walked into the sea to drown herself.

The stock has been consolidating since September 2017 high of 156.This consolidation has come in the form of a contracting triangle pattern during which prices hovered in a range of 135-134 on the downside and 156-157 on the upside.The stock has recently registered a resolute break out of this pattern with strong volume signalling resumption of the up move and provides fresh entry opportunity.The time-wise correction seen in the fourth quarter of last year barely retraced 38.2% of the up move from May 2017 low of 104.10 to October 2017 high of 157.50.Such a shallow price correction and extended time correction following a period of sustained gains augers well for the stock from a medium-term perspectiveWe believe the consolidation phase that lasted over 15 weeks has come to maturity, in turn, giving a fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to move higher and test our target area of 182 in the medium term as it is the pattern implication of a Triangle consolidation (158-133) as projected above the breakout level of 157.NRB Bearings: BUY| CMP Rs169| Target Rs204| Stop Loss Rs153| Return 20%| Time Frame 3 monthsThe share price of NRB Bearings has recently registered a 24 months consolidation breakout from the broad range of 162 and 100 with the strong volume of almost three times the 12 months average volume of 30 lakhs share per month indicating larger participation in the direction of the trend.After a strong rally in December 2017, the stock entered a consolidation phase over the last four weeks during, which it formed a higher low after having retraced just 38.2% of the preceding rally | 141 to | 182 indicating robust price structure.Monthly MACD is in a strong uptrend and has recently generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus supports the positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to head higher in the near-term towards 205, being the price parity of the previous up move from 141 to 182 as projected from a recent trough of 164.Disclaimer: The author is Head Technical, AVP at ICICI Direct.com Research.

Asian Paints has given cautiously optimistic outlook on demand as economy post-GST implementation has started stabilising.The demand scenario looks encouraging as low penetration in small towns/rural India and GOI focus on affordable housing boosts demand for decorative paints in coming years.The near-term margin pressure looks likely as input costs linked to crude and Tio2 have firmed up. The domestic brokerage firm expects Asian Paints to outperform Kansai Nerolac (30% outperformance over APNT in 12 months) as it has just 5 percent contribution from Auto and Industrial paints (lower pricing power) than 40 percent for Kansai.Dr Reddy’s LaboratoriesLtd: Overweight| Target Rs3133| Return 22%Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight rating on Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories with a target price of Rs3133.

Hence, not every bank will do all types of lending. Large project lending requiring specialised underwriting skills is going to be a forte of the few large/specialised banks whereas majority of the surviving mid-sized PSBs will focus on lending to small & medium sized enterprises.Lending will be much more ring-fenced with rigorous due diligence. Loans above Rs 250 crore will be specially monitored with red flags if covenants are breached.related news100% FDI in single-brand retail: A much-needed booster shot?Can relaxed investment norms help Air India find buyers?ONGC HPCL deal – valuation premium for synergies or to plug the fiscal gap?In addition the focus areas are going to be facilitating lending to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises' (MSMEs) through the portal 'Udyami Mitra' launched by SIDBI, deepening financial inclusion and promoting digitisation.The great banking recapitalisationOut of the total Rs 2 lakh 11 thousand crore of recapitalisation, government has specified the first tranche of \xa0over Rs 1 lakh crore – Rs 8139 crore from gross budgetary support, Rs 10,312 crore from the market and the remaining Rs 88,000 crore through recapitalisation bonds.The recapitalisation bonds will be liquidity neutral. It will be swap transaction whereby PSBs will subscribe to these recapitalisation bonds (that are not going to be a part of their SLR securities) and government in turn will infuse equity capital to these entities.Capital for the ailingHowever, the capital is being given to the healthier group for growth and to the others for survival and to give them a “second chance”. In fact, 60% of the capital in the first tranche is going to go to the weaker entities (that are under Prompt & Corrective Action of RBI). The objective is to infuse regulatory capital, strengthen governance and operations. These entities would be subject to close monitoring and would be eligible for capital based on performance.This should give a decent boost to their capital adequacy. But weighed down by asset quality woes, their ability to participate in the credit market remains a remote possibility. However, the capital will help them comply with the provisioning requirements as bad asset resolution gathers steam.(CAR – capital adequacy ratio, GNPA – gross non-performing assets)In the past one year, majority of these banks have not participated in disbursing credit and we do not see an imminent recovery, thereby giving the well-capitalised competitors with strong liability an edge.However, the quantum of capital given to IDBI Bank and Bank of India shows government’s serious intention in reviving these entities and a possible move to privatise IDBI at a later stage cannot be ruled out.Capital for growthGovernment has also decided to infuse more capital to the healthy PSBs as they are likely to take up the baton of growth in the upturn of the credit cycle.Some of the entities like SBI, PNB and Union Bank have raised capital (by way of Qualified Institutional Placement) in recent times and should make good use of the additional support in bringing the requisite risk appetite back.In this group, however, the superior quality of liability will be the key differentiator in winning the market share game as the market has moved to MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) based lending. In a rising rate regime, cost of funds will be a key differentiator.In addition to recapitalisation, these PSBs will actively pursue possibilities of exiting from non-core businesses and monetising real estates. The government has also reassured depositors that their money is safe and reiterated its commitment to tackle large bad loans through NCLT (national company law tribunal).So who gains the most?Unequivocally it is the Indian economy. Through recapitalisation, government has created additional credit off take capacity of more than Rs 5 lakh crore -\xa0\xa0 6% of outstanding bank credit and 60% of the incremental credit of the past one year.Credit growth has seen a turnaround (11% year on year growth from the lows of 5%). Not just for the demonetisation base, large section of bankers are guiding to a genuine revival. The recap will only bolster this momentum.The capital especially to the banks under PCA will help expedite the resolution process under NCLT as banks would be required to take significant provisioning in the coming few quarters.The momentum in credit growth and resolution of NPA spell good news for well capitalised private entities. In a market that will incrementally chase high quality credit, the strength of the liability franchise will differentiate the men from the boys.

Despite this fact, people still avoid it due to the complicated rules of investment like compulsory certain proportionate of investment into an annuity, taxation of at least 20% of the corpus at the time of withdrawal, etc. “What will make this a popular mode of investment is if these rules of investment are simplified and the tax implication gets reduced.

It is much more than just a partnership on infrastructure and it will cause significant improvement in lives of people from different countries,"" Abbasi said.He further said half of humanity lives in this region and this initiative will have a big impact towards a shared future in a fractured world.The BRI is a physical manifestation of the bond between countries that have existed through history and can result in freer movement of people, goods and ideas, and a greater culture of openness, Abbasi said.He also said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has started to show results with a big boost to manufacturing and exports.The key principles are financial stability and lessening of environmental impact and Pakistan being a more responsible global citizen, he said.Speaking in the same session, Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank President Jim Liqun also lauded the initiative and the benefits it would bring to the region.Liqun said financial sustainability is key to the long- term success of the initiative.""We should never do a project that would be a white elephant,"" he observed.Singapore\'s Minister in Prime Minister\'s Office Chan Chun Sing said the city-state is very happy to be part of the BRI and believes it will help in a big way in contributing to global growth.He said Singapore is closely working with the Chinese agencies for this project.US-based infra consultancy major Aecom\'s Chairman Michael Burke said BRI is the largest infrastructure project seen in our lifetime and will have a big impact on the GDP of the region with free movement of goods and other benefits.He said such a project cannot be completed by a single country or by just private or public sector and therefore Aecom expects to participate in it in a big way for many years to come.Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev said the fractured world is being discussed in Davos and the BRI initiative is one of the best ways to address this.']"
